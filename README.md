# Text-Analytics---Car-Brand-Analysis

In this assignment,our team assumed the role of an analytics consultant to a (i) brand manager, (ii) product manager and (iii) advertising manager. Our job was to give advice/insights to these individuals based on the analysis of social media conversations. The tasks are described below. We use cars as an example of a “high involvement” good (recall from class discussions that for high involvement goods, people use social media heavily for awareness building and research). 

## Tasks

1. Write a scraper using Selenium to fetch messages posted in Edmunds.com discussion forums. Fetch around 4,000-5000 posts about cars from a General topics forum. We used an entry level luxury car forum.

2. Identify top 10 brands by frequency. From the posts, calculate lift ratios for associations between the brands. Show the brands on a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) map 

3. What insights can you offer brand managers from your analysis in Task 2?

4. What are 5 most frequently mentioned attributes of cars in the discussions? Which attributes are most strongly associated with which of the 5 most frequently mentioned brands? 

5. What advice will you give to a (i) product manager, and (ii) marketing/advertising manager of these brands based on your analysis in Task 4? 

6. Which is the most aspirational brand in your data in terms of people actually wanting to buy or own? Describe your analysis. What are the business implications for this brand?

0,merc1,"March 25, 2002 5:54AM","I personally think that with a few tweaks the C320 could also sit at the top of this group. It's still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than Mercedes would lead you to believe. The C320 ""Sport"" needs to have it's suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride. MB also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package. The C240's 6-speed wouldn't hurt either if offered on the C320, though it needs to be ""fixed"" first.

That said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new A4 3.0. The A4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40K car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite. The single thing I don't like about the A4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car. This trim doesn't match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway. This is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40K. The upcoming A4 Convertible, Coupe and S4 WILL all be winners.

The BMW 330i is now an old favorite, but I'm (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-Series just a bit, save the M3 variants. I was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling. I hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models.

The Acura TL-S is easily my favorite fwd car in this class. Wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver. Nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the TL is so popular. This car's main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc. Otherwise a standout.

Lexus ES300. Nice, but not my type of car at all. This is one for the Buick set. The IS300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis. Styling is also in question here, it simply doesn't look like a 35K car (grown). The interior is gawd-awful. Bet on the next IS300 being done right from the start. In their defense Toyota didn't initially intend for this car to be sold in the U.S. so it was a rush job.

The CTS holds the greatest unrealized potential here. I've seen several now, and each time I see one they look better and better. Again like the C320, IS300 the car has interior issues. The dash feels like it was made by Rubbermaid. If you're going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother? Half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car??? The seats are very good though, as is the handling. A work in progress.

The G35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces. Another great engine, waiting to drive this one.

Don't really care much for the X-Type. If I were a Jaguar man I'd be truly pissed at Ford and Jaguar for this one. They are actually selling a fwd X-Type in England and I've read where they're thinking about selling it here! Hell no. The car should have been rwd not awd. Some will tell you that this was done to compete with Audi. Thats BS, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, WITHOUT spending the money to convert the car to rwd. It is a good looking car though and that Jaguar ""leaper"" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me.

The Chrysler 300M is about as close to an Audi that American cars come. This new 300M ""Special"" is truly a good looking car inside and out. One problem: Where is the performance???? A 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable. Something is not right here. Some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, Chrysler needs to let some MB engineers have a look at this car. The heavier E320 with less power is faster. I still like this car, but it's no lust object once you get past the great styling.

1,fredvh,"March 25, 2002 7:06AM",I am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. The price difference between these two is approx. 6K (non-Type S Acura). Is the ES300 worth 6K over the TL? I don't know because I have never owned a TL but I am familiar with the ES300(previous generation). Supposedly the 2002 ES300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the TL? Of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. Does the TL compare with the ES300 in both of these categorys? I am not familiar with the Honda Co. Are prices lower than Lexus for service work? I would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some TL owners.

Riez, I read from your profile that you have a manual BMW 5-series. But I think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a Infiniti G35 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan. From your logic, then the BMW 3-series (your wife's) or the 5-series with the Steptronic should not be contenders either. That's belittling the Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, Acuras, BMW's etc. with automatics.

When I return in December from Qatar, I plan on purchasing a sports sedan. I'm leaning on the G35, but the BMW 330i along with the Audi S4 are also contenders. IMO, if the handling of the Infiniti is as good as the BMW as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. Also my first choice will be a manual, and Infiniti should have the manual out by December. I will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there.

I do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. But, automatics in this category, especially those made by BMW, Infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedans. Different flavors for different people.

I have been following discussions on many boards and what I have been noticing is that there is so many ""experts"" on what is the best sports sedan. And most haven't even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion. This is not aimed at you Riez or Shipko, because your profiles states that you own a BMW already. But from what I noticed is that some BMW ""supportors"" don't even own a BMW, (at least not from their profile) or they state that they never drove an Infiniti G35, but they still make ""unsupported"" facts, assumptions or opinions on such. (See the Edmund's BMW 3-series discussion). I hope in your defense, Reiz, that you drove the automatic Infiniti G35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn't classify as a performance sedan. I value your opinion and others as well.

Again, I'm not flaming you, but I try to be an informed consumer before I buy anything. That is the reason that I will drive every car that I'm interested in and make my choice from there. I'm also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car I'm shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.

Cheers!"
13,hungrywhale,"March 27, 2002 5:00PM","I think what riez and I are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them

But any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan NEEDS at least the option of a manual tranny. Manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.

There's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but I sure don't want one."

It does make a difference being married. (LOL! see the latest discussions on the Infiniti G35 vs BMW 330i board). First, I'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. Not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic. But she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice I'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. Of course, it helps my cause when I let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. Bribes do help! Whatever I finally decide, I'm sure she'll be happy."

If you want affordable and can go FWD, then add Nissan Maxima 6-speed with LSD and maybe Altima 3.5SE 5-speed.

The interior is as nice as a car can get. If I had the money, I would buy an ES300 in a heartbeat.

31,popovs,"April 14, 2002 8:09AM","I think both are excellent(sp?) cars, however neither one is a low maintenance automobile. That is to say neither brand is known for low maintenance. What they do offer is luxury and performance in an aesthetically pleasing package and, some would argue, a superior ownership experience.

As someone has said before, every manifacturer makes lemons - some more than others - but the internet is not the best place to find information about that. Most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community.

Although I can not speak as to the driving merits of the cars, I suspect that they are similar since I've heard (read) good things about both the A4 CVT and the C240. Something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry, it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology.

Both cars are relative newcommers to the market. The facts that they are made by distinguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the cars will be as a whole.

Since you are already looking for alternatives to the MB because of reliability concerns, it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the Audi. As someone has suggested in the Help me Choose! forum, try looking to Lexus for the answer. They seem to make reliable cars that are also cheap to keep running. Of course now we get into the issue of European vs Asian luxury ..."
32,popovs,"April 17, 2002 9:23AM","It has come to my attention that as of late MB has taken a hit in its reputation. People have been quick to point at the recent survey results - both European and Domestic - that say Mercedes is no longer reliable. These surveys show that statistically speaking MB has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty. I won't deny these findings, but I will try and justify them.

1st and foremost, MB has and is comming out with newer designs every year, updating the cars both inside and out. Anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out.

Secondly, according to mbspy.com, Mercedes accounted for ~half of the profits by DCX last year. I think MB is being used as a cash cow to keep Jeep and Co affloat, thereby driving Mercedes to cost-cutting through corparate pressure. Lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality.

These two should get things going ... Feel free to agree or disagree."
33,mvargo1,"April 17, 2002 7:37PM","There is not much to debate on this subject. If you want a reliable car you buy Japanese. If you want a drivers car you used to have to buy european. The Japanese just do quality better and more consistantly than anyone else. You also get a lot more car for your money with a Japanese vehicle. There was a time when the europeans built the best driving cars in the world. Sadly for them those days are passing. The Japanese keep building cars that are closer and closer to european driving dynamics (IS and GS series Lexus(Lexi?), and Q45 and G35 Infiniti's) While the europeans quality especially Daimler/Chrysler just is not keeping up."

Although I have the money to buy these cars, I also have other fun things and places to spend it. I'm looking to buy the car and keep it for around 7-10 years. Its very sunny with no snow here as well. I also want an automatic or CVT(gasp).

So right now, the five I am going to look at more closely are as follows:

1) BMW 330i
2) Audi A4 3.0 CVT
3) Infiniti G35
4) Acura TL-S
5) Nissan Altima 3.5 SE

The BMW represents the top of the class, but it also has the highest price. The Altima represents the most performance oriented family car, which is a cheaper class of cars. The BMW and Altima will bracket the value equation. The other three all have the potential to compete for my dollars.

Cars that are missing, IS300 too small, while the styling of the CTS, S60 T5, and 9-5 Aero are not for me. The ES300 and I35 don't have enough performance for me. Everything more expensive than a comparibly equipped 330i was also excluded.

36,riez,"April 18, 2002 11:50PM","cybersol... I can't fathom why you would want to go with slushbox, but that is your loss.

Comparing FWD to RWD is like apples to oranges.

Not sure what sort of real price range you are looking at. The 330i with options might push $40,000. You might really consider the much less expensive 325i. An Altima 3.5SE with few options might have a $25,000 MSRP.

Read Motor Trend's review of I35. Their's had more than enough performance. 0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds, fastest in their comparison test. And it can be had with a Sport Package. But you might be better off with a loaded Maxima SE or GLE, saving thousands off the I35.

You might also consider Volkwagen Passat. That can also be had with AWD. If you like AWD, the Jag X-type should be on your list.

From the domestic corner, you might also consider a Lincoln LS 6 or 8. Or Chrysler 300M.

Surprised your list excludes the Mercedes-Benz C-class.

And if you can live with a FWD automatic, a loaded Camry or Accord V-6 or Avalon might be acceptable near the Altima's price range."
37,cybersol,"April 19, 2002 1:07AM","Sorry to disappoint with the slushbox, but if we were all the same life would be boring (and there would only be 1 car type).

I would prefer RWD, but the best FWD's (torque sensitive steering) are getting close enough to bring the acceptable price premium for RWD down. Price range is 25-40K as you mention.

Passat, 300M, 325i, are too slow for me. The C Classes are either too slow or more expensive than the BMW. I would choose the BMW over the X-type, as they are similarly priced and I live in sun country.

The maxima (better value than the I35) is a good suggestion, and I am considering that equally with the Altima at the lower end.

My wife loves Camry's, but I'm looking for excitement. slushbox or not.

38,kdshapiro,"April 19, 2002 2:14AM","The new Altima is great as my friends just bought one. However, dollar for dollar I think the Maxima is the over-all winner for a FWD car. If you can live without the amenities of the I35 the GLE with leather, sunroof, BOSE can't be beat. I've owned two Maximas. Me! I recently made the jump to the 330i, and it's been worth every penny. However the G35 owners are very passionate about their choices. For a couple of dollars more than the Maxima, hovering around the I35 I guess, the TL-S can't be beat either.

I understand when it comes down to it, you pick what you think has the right combination of value, performance, luxury and the right type of car for you. For every person it is different. When I got the BMW I was cross-shopping SUVs, mini-vans, and FWD passenger cars to see what struck my fancy, and I was ready to get an Explorer."
39,riez,"April 19, 2002 2:18AM","cybersol... Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible. I can't get too excited about FWDers. Certainly not a slushbox FWDer.

Not sure what you mean about ""the best FWDers (torque sensitive steering)"".

Very powerful FWDers tend to suffer from severe torque steering. Use of equal length half-shafts and limited slip differential can help, but not completely eliminate. The laws of physics remain. When the drive wheels and steering wheels are one and the same, and you have a powerful motor, you'll get some torque steering.

Do you have kids? Plan to in near future? If not, have you considered any coupes or convertibles? They can be a bit more exciting."
40,dave330i,"April 19, 2002 3:28PM","""Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.""

Agreed. Unfortunately, most American drivers don't seem to get it. They care about silly stuff like 0-60, 1/4 mile, hp & torque numbers, but choose to miss out on the fun part of driving."
41,cybersol,"April 20, 2002 8:18AM","Riez, you have heard of speed sensitive steering? This varies the power steering boost as with the speed. Acura claims to have torque sensitive power steering on the TL-S (not the TL though). This would supposedly vary the power steering boost with the torque being applied. And that in theory could eliminate a large amount of torque steer found in powerful FWD cars. It still doesn't eliminate the FWD tendency to under steer due the the drive wheels being the same as the turning wheels."
42,riez,"April 20, 2002 4:49PM","cybersol... There are two types. Those tied to engine output and those tied to road speed. I have heard that the latter are superior, since you can vary engine speeds (RPMs) a lot, depending upon gear being used and speed, even while driving relative steady speeds. Better systems vary boost on road speed, since you normally need more assist at low speeds, regardless of engine RPMs.

Here is all that the lengthy full-color TL brochure says: ""Steering: Variable Power-Assist Rack-and-Pinion"". This is off the tech specs on page 30. I cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure. So if Acura thinks its variable assist power steering system is special, they are keeping it a secret. This large brochure covers both the TL and TL Type S."
43,cybersol,"April 21, 2002 7:36AM","Yeah, I have that brouchure and they don't mention the difference between the TL and TL-S, though they say both have variable power assist. They do not say how it varies.

But on the Acura website. TL -> Specifications -> Body/Suspension/Chassis it says:


Steering Type

TL Type S - Torque-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering

3.2TL - Speed-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering


Here's the link if you want to check it out:

http://www.acura.com/model_TL/tl_spec_results.asp


Hard to find, but not a secret."
44,riez,"April 21, 2002 1:50PM","cybersol... From what I've read, the better variable power assist system is tied to road speed, not engine RPMs. Once you get a car up to 25 mph or more, there isn't much need for assist, even if your RPMs decline due to turning or downshifting. And certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isn't much need for assist no matter what happens to your RPMs.

But keep in mind that torque steering isn't due to the steering system. It is due to other factors. Can be very pronounced in powerful FWDers. Corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal half-shafts. Need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels.

From standing start, floor your car. See if the wheel pulls in one direction. You'll have to correct with the steering wheel (to keep the car straight) but by then you'll have already encountered the torque steering.

I see a difference of about $5K, 30hp, and a sporty suspension. Why shouldn't I load up a 3.0, rather than going after the S4?

Oh, and does anyone know on possible improvements for one or the other for 2003?"
46,cybersol,"April 25, 2002 12:15AM","Have you driven them both? The S4 really moves. Even by Audi's own 0-60 times the S4 manual is 1 second faster and the S4 tiptronic is 1.2 seconds faster.

Yet, the S4 is currently based on the 2001 A4 platform, and it is scheduled to be upgraded to the new platform in the 2003 model year. Expect the performance difference to increase as the indications are that the new S4 will pack 300 or more hp.

Hope this helps."
47,beartrax79,"April 25, 2002 7:36PM","I've tested the 3.0, not the S4. Hmmm... new S4 in '03, huh? Maybe I should just wait. What do you think, cybersol? Right now, th3 current S4 states 250hp, yes?"
48,cybersol,"April 26, 2002 4:50PM","Yeah, the current S4 has 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. The torque is fully online by 1850 rpm. So this is why it scoots.

The new S4 should be really nice. If you have the time to wait, it might be worth seeing. It might move up in price a little if the performance gets closer to the BMW M3, but then the old S4's should be easier to pick up at a good price right as the new ones are coming out. So many decisions.

Have fun making the right one for you!"
49,1pierce,"April 27, 2002 9:37PM","Not so fast. There is merit to the ""nationality based"" debate. Let me explain to you why Japanese cars have higher quality (in terms of reliability) than American or European cars. The reason is cultural.

Americans have always had an adventurous, entrepreneurial spirit. We take chances. Its not in our nature to ""accept"" things as they are. I think this is somewhat genetic, since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants - aren't we all, really - people who took tremendous risk, and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life. As such, in areas of design, we bore very easily. Americans are always looking for the next great thing, the next new design, the next technology breakthrough. Europeans, especially Germans, are like this about cars, if not about everything else. The US auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch - witness Chrysler and Ford over the last two decades. As such, our products are usually stylish and inventive, but not very refined - see minivans, SUV's, cab-forward, night-vision, etc..

The Japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old. They have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo. We had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th century after world war II. I know this is somewhat simplistic, but bear with me. What the Japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year, until it is near perfect. There is very little innovation or risk taking. That is why the cars are so bland. When was the last time you saw a new technology invented in Japan? VCR's, computer technology, cell phones, the microwave oven...all American inventions that are better built by the Japanese. The same goes for cars. Most innovations come from the US or Germany, with some safety innovations coming from Scandinavia (give up the turbos and 5-cylinders, already those are as refined as they're going to get!).

Anyway,...when you distill it down to its essence, this is why Toyotas and Hondas never break. Its also why they are no more than transportation appliances. And, this is why the best performance cars from Japan will always be knock-offs (albeit sometimes very good ones) of something somebody else does better and more originally.

I'll step off my soap box now, and await your wailing."
50,wishnhigh1,"April 27, 2002 9:54PM","The problem is that they are HUGE generalizations. Also, you are talking Japanese as almost exclusivly Honda and Toyota. What about Subaru, Mazda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu, and Suzuki? So far the only makes that seem to keep with that Japanese Culture are Toyota and Honda.

And many American and European makes are now capable of having higher quality than more than 70% of Japanese cars. Doesn't help your generalization that much, does it?

So where do the generalizations stop? They should stop with brands, and not nations."
51,kd6aw1,"April 28, 2002 2:38AM","Have found out that with some of the more powerful cars like the G35 or Corvette the difference in performance from a practical standpoint isn't really an issue because these cars are faster than we can ever dream of driving without either killing ourselves or getting tickets all the time. I have an automatic G35 and love it. Being that it is an automatic I can enjoy my coffee, shave, talk on my cel phone and hug my wife while driving in rush hour traffic.

====================================

Those cars in general reflect the perfectionist attitude of 1pierce's post. With virtually no exception, the overall quality of Japanese brand cars, especially fit and finish, considerably excels the American brands. From what I have read, this is due to the attitude of Japanese management in not accepting mediocre craftsmanship. Not the abilities of the assembly line workers. You may have a point though, that some of the Japanese brands show as high a level of innovation as the American and German brands. After all, which country has used the Wankle rotary, and Miller cycle engines? And who introduced us to the VTEC engines etc?

American management leans strongly to the bottom line and CEO bonuses, with refinement and polish falling by the wayside as a casuality of the heavy handed management style."

58,rayainsw,"May 28, 2002 2:50PM","I beg to differ.

While I admit that I am biased (obviously, since I bought one!) I believe that the W8 is really a performance sedan.

I test drove the G35, and several BMWs (and a few others) before making my final choice. I suppose the term &#145;performance sedan&#146; could be defined in any number of ways. For me, the W8 offers everything I want &#150; and nothing I don&#146;t.

(Isn&#146;t that a recent Nissan &#145;tag line&#146;?)

Take straight line acceleration, for instance. VW literature quotes 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec. To me, this is pretty quick for a 4 door sedan. My fearless (?) prediction of future test acceleration numbers is: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec., as VW claims. And a quarter mile in about 15.0 at 94 / 95. I base this on a number of things. For instance, in the May 2000 Car and Driver comparison that included the Lincoln LS8 Sport and the Audi A6 2.7TT, the Audi tested had virtually identical curb weight as the W8, identical final drive, wheel / tire size and Tiptronic. The HP / TQ for this Audi were 250 / 258. And their test results were: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.6 sec. and the quarter mile in 15.1 at 94. Thus, my W8 with 270 / 273 ought to do slightly better. We&#146;ll see. . . (BTW: in the same test, the Lincoln LS8 Sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of: 0 &#150; 60 in 7.5 and the quarter mile in 15.7 at 90. This was my previous car. So, it seems reasonable that my W8 feels quicker &#150; setting aside the notorious un-reliability of everyone&#146;s &#145;butt dyno&#146;!)

Does it pull the same lateral G as the G35 or a BMW 3 series w/Sport Package. Almost certainly no. But with more aggressive rubber, I expect that it will provide enough grip for entertainment value at any sane public road speed.

Just my opinions.

59,cmnott,"June 4, 2002 7:13PM","I recently went through the list of entry level cars...I was in test drive heaven!

325i - very nice car, best shifter/clutch of all, but not enough power for me. Great motor though as fas as smoothness. the interior is average, nothing better. With leather and wood it helps but you either dig it or you don't.

330i - same as above but better power, although I find the power to be linear. You can really move in this car but the sensation of thrust is lacking. I like that sunroof and leather are std. Better value overall than 325i plus std. 17"" wheels (although with all-seasons). Pricy.

IS300- Nice manual tranny and smooth motor. That's about it. hate the interior, feels claustrophobic and chintzy.

X-Type - I liked the 3.0L Sport, but did not like the grey stained maple. Didn't look like a jag. Very nearly purchased a 3.0L British Racing Green with Ivory Leather and beautiful walnut but with options this car is riciulously overpriced, makes the BMW look like a bargain hunter. Too bad, nice motor and very good manual tranny and ride. Brakes were strong. One thing about the motor was it just didn't feel or go like 0-60 6.5 as advertised. Nicest interior overall.

A4 3.0 - Porky, ponderous even with sport package. Did not feel swift and easily the worst tranny available in this segment. Nice interior, leather was only average. you could barely tell the difference between the leather and leatherette, which is a good thing if you are cheap, but bad if you opt for leather. By the way, the leather in the BMW was much better.

S4 (2001)- Nice but not as fast as I thought it would be (I did drive a 99 Mustang GT). It rockets off the line but it isn't that impressive afterwards. Nicer seats and support but interior is too gloomy. 250bhp and 258 lb ft. motor is not an audible delight, the 2002 A4 3.0 sounds amazing compared to the S4. I think the backpressure has gobbled up the exhaust note. An exhaust would be perfect here. They were giving them away (9000$ off MSRP - and people were definitely buying!) but it just looked dated now beside the new ones.

G35 - went and looked at one in showroom and was not impressed and without a manual tranny, I wasn't interested one bit. I still managed to drive one and was impressed with the torque, it definitely had thrust that the others lacked (except the S4). Nice seats and neat touches for rear passengers. I really liked the dynamics of the car but the tranny left me cold. The fit and finish was poor, maybe it was an early model...no dicker sticker which made it cost as much as the A4 3.0 and BMW 330i was close.

Lincoln LS V6 - very good handling and crisp 5 speed. Engine was thrashy at high revs which is particularly bad because it needs to be revved to really move. Torque is lacking here. But I liked the car overall, especially with the Sport susp.

Acura TL-S, another auto tranny but an incredible motor, definitely my favourite V6 of all of them as far as sound is concerned. Interior average and handling so-so. Excellent price.

Volvo S60 T5 - I chose this car for its thrust (come to think of it 3bhp less and 15 lb.ft less than the S4 is quite close to the S4, and it is lighter) FWD torque steer is evident only beyond 8/10ths, but it is there, no question about it. Best seats, best stereo, average steering feel falls behind the Jaguar and BMW. Brakes while strong are grabby but it takes getting used to. Amazing power and style. Seems decent off the line but after 100km/h it easily pulls the hardest. Price was also a consideration as it was cheaper than BMW, Audi, Jaguar.

Didn't drive the CTS but I am sure it is excellent.

In conclusion these are all excellent cars and even though we all nitpick this and that on all of them, I would be fine with any of them in my driveway. Honestly."
60,blueguydotcom,"June 4, 2002 9:27PM","I had the grave misfortune to drive a CTS, and it's not in the same league as the Bimmer, Audi, Infiniti or even the lesser Acura/Lexus/Jag.

The CTS i drove was a 5 speed sport model with a sticker of 38k (gasp!). The tranny was rough, very rough, almost Mustang bad. The interior felt cheap with lots of hard plastic and very little in the way of substantial or soft-touch materials. The throttle response was weak and required excessive modulation of a rather awkward gas pedal. The car's a rolling bed of 1998 technology, no automatic brake distribution for one thing. The salesmen kept insisting 4 channel ABS is impressive...to each his own. Handling? Nothing at all like the claims car mags are making. It was a slow reacting boat...turn the wheels, feel the car undulate and then slowly shift directions. Not impressive in the least. In fact when the salesguy asked me what I thought after the drive I told him the CTS wasn't even a real competitor to the germans or japanese. He snorted and reminded me, ""This is a caddy, not a sports car."" Yeah, well that Caddy can sit on the lot with the other heaps they have."

62,cmnott,"June 5, 2002 3:11PM","Hey blueguy, what wrond with the Mustang tranny! I know it is not a FWD type gearbox but when you have 300 lb.ft. of torque twisting that car, you need a strong tranny. In all honesty, the clutch, while incredibly easy to modulate was hevay, but with a purpose. never missed a gear either, which can't be said about the A4 6-speed...

jagboyxkr, I know you have an X-Type and I was right in there to the end with this car. Bottom line was 10000CDN difference. The way they package the options is ridiculous. i needed the split fold seats, but they were bundled in a $2000 package. Xenons? Twice asmuch as any other car, $1600.00. Sunroof? another 1600.00. It was unbeleivable but the lease rate was very low (1.9%) which helped make up the difference.

I don't care what anybody says about the X-Type, because most have never driven them, it is IMO, a better overall car than the Audi. In Canada, AWD is recommended...this car gets slaughtered because of its high price. This car should have been priced equal to the leader of the class, but to price it more than the best car in the segment is suicide in this hot market.

The T5 is broken in nicely, I have over 2000 miles on it now and it is everything I expected. What i didn't expect was the sheer power this thing has after 100km'h. I think it would beat my Mustang at that speed in a rolling start, no question. i would even say an S4..."

69,eaweg,"June 27, 2002 6:03PM","So that stones aren't casted at one another, I would like to remind everyone that this is my opinion which is why we have these forums.

Cmnott, I respect your opinion about the jag and the audi 3.0...although I strongly disagree. I guess as a 3.0 owner I would. I personally found the jag x-type to be the worst car I have ever test driven. First, it was $3000 more than the Audi. Second, well it is a ford and felt like a ford. The handling in no way compared to the 3.0. The interior might ""look"" a little better but certainly did not ""feel"" any better. AS for performance, I am a little dissapointed with th 3.0 and I think they could have used a 250-260 hp engine to solve the problems. However, it is still a fun engine...especially at highway speeds. I honetsly felt that the Mondeo (excuse me, x-type) was going to fall apart on my test drive.

Now I know Audi has had its problems but not even close to comparison with the negative headlines for the x-type!

Oh well...to each their own! Enjoy your T5!!!"
70,jagboyxtype,"June 28, 2002 4:10AM","I came to a different conclusion about the Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 and the Audi A4 3.0 Quattro. I was considering both vehicles, and it was very close, but the Jaguar won for me.

ACCELERATION:
In acceleration times, the Jaguar is clearly faster than the Audi. Car&Driver states of the X-TYPE, ""Subjectively, the X-TYPE didn't feel quite as quick as a BMW 330i. But a few instrumented acceleration runs revealed that the measured 0-to-60-mph time of 6.3 seconds was only 0.2 seconds slower than the small BMW. We would rate the smoothness of the X-TYPE's V-6 to be similarly close to that of the Bavarian in-line six.""

Road&Track says of the X-TYPE's performance, ""In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest. Accompanied by a nice-but-distant exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300's and Audi A4's 7.1, the Mercedes C320's 6.8 sec. and matching the BMW 330i's time.""

-Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 acceleration times: 6.3 - 6.5 sec*.
-Audi A4 3.0 Quattro acceleration time: 7.1 sec*.

* = manual transmission.

HANDLING:
Of how the cars handle, R&T says of the X-TYPE, ""Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work. It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners. Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkietalkies we all carry and said, 'This thing is really good in the curves!' It's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. The engine is not bad either. Our test car's optional 3.0-liter 4-cam V-6 (there's a less expensive 2.5 version as well) put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort.""

They also say of its suspension, ""Jaguar engineers told us they wanted the suspension to be 'connected but relaxed,'and that seems to wrap it up nicely. The ride is about as smooth as you'll find in this class, even with the Sport suspension. Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivers surprisingly good handling.""

Of the Audi's handling, they say, ""Dynamically, the all-wheel-drive car is not as crisp as it looks. It handles well enough and has a superb highway ride, but it accomplishes these goals in a rather soft and rubbery style of suspension tuning and steering...In short, the Audi is missing that firm, rally-car edge and sense of steering precision that makes the BMW, for instance, so delightful to drive. It's a car that can keep up with the other sports sedans, but doesn't feel very sporty doing it, despite our car's having the optional sport suspension for $750...We noticed in some of the whoop-de-dos and curves of our desert highway that the Audi produced 'considerable excitement,' as one driver put it, and was simply more floaty and loose than the others. And again, 'This is where you pay for that great highway ride,' one driver noted. The 3.0-liter 220-bhp dohc aluminum V-6 is smooth and reasonably peppy, though well back from the front of this pack.""

STEERING:
Motor Trend says of the X-TYPE's ZF Servotronic II variable-ratio speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system, ""The car's best system may be its speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering. In fact, it matches the previously unrivaled precision served up by BMW 3 Series. Car placement feels laser-guided precise, with excellent feedback and road feel. With complete confidence and comfort, we drove at most times with just our fingertips - even at 120 mph on the track. The only all-wheel-drive car we've ever driven offering similar levels of steering communication is the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a pretty racy piece.""

The Audi's steering was criticized again by Car & Driver and Road & Track for being, ""rubbery"" in feeling, and C&D said that the ""steering wheel vibrates at peak engine revs.""

Car&Driver also says that the steering system of the X-TYPE ""is nothing short of terrific."" They call it ""enthusiast goods"".

Forbes even takes note of the steering system in the X, ""Jaguar engineers boast it's the best steering system they've ever had on any model. We agree.""

ALL-WHEEL-DRIVE:
Audi is known for its Quattro AWD system, which has been develped for over 22 years now. Quattro IV its newest version, and is used on the A4. It divides power 50/50 to the front and rear wheels unless slip is detected, and is known to be one of the best systems available. Torque steer is said to be very minor, and it is said to work well with even the turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder versions of the A4, although it is noted by some to feel heavy without the larger V6. Audi also used Quattro to prove that AWD in certain racing conditions could be better than other setups, and later was banned from using AWD cars in certain races because of its advantages.

Jaguar uses a new AWD system they designed called Traction 4, which divides torque 40% to the front wheels, and 60% to the rear unless slip is detected. This, along with specially designed roller bearings fitted between the tops of the front strut towers and the body, along with its advanced steering mechanism, give the performance and feel of a RWD car. Unlike most AWD systems, Car&Driver said that Traction 4 produces no torque steer to interphere with the purity of the steering.

Forbes stated of the X-TYPE's AWD, ""The X-TYPE gets a seemless, virtually transparent new 40/60 viscous coupling all-wheel-drive system with optional dynamic stability control that rivals Audi's vaunted Quattro for wet- and dry- weather grip.""

Road&Track said that, ""...The Jag is better balanced. It will understeer during turn-in, take something of a set, and then pull you through. It's a safe and secure feeling that signals what's about to happen and gives you plenty of time to adjust""

BRAKING:
The X-TYPE features the same vented front and solid rear discs as found on the larger S-TYPE.

Road & Track said, ""In braking tests, the X-TYPE had impressive and easily repeatable stopping distances from 60 mph (118 ft.) and 80 mph (208 ft.)"" In another one of their articles, they say, ""The braking distances turned by the X-TYPE are exceptional, comparable to those of top sports cars.""

Car & Driver also said, ""A few laps at the Castle Combe racetrack allowed us to explore the outer reaches of the X-TYPE's handling, where it proved completely benign, thanks to the all-wheel-drive. Even at the limit, understeer never grinds the front tires excessively, but the only way to get the tail out was to flick the steering wheel while simultaneously lifting the throttle. The four-wheel disc brakes proved linear and powerful under repeated heavy track use.""

By comparison, a BMW M-Roadster stops from 60 mph in the same 118 feet as the Jag. The Porsche 911 GT2 stops from 60 just two feet shorter than the Jag, at 116 feet. An SLK32 AMG does"
71,jagboyxtype,"June 28, 2002 4:10AM","it in 127 feet.

-Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 braking distance from 60 mph: 118 ft.
-Audi A4 3.0 Quattro braking distance from 60 mph: 137 ft.

ITERIOR:
Here is where the statements become subjective, and anything I say here other than what is quoted from others is just my opinion.

Both the Audi and the Jaguar offer excellent interiors. The Jaguar goes for the warm-looking British cabin that its family members also display, utilizing massive amounts of wood and Conolly leather with bits of chrome; the Audi has a German, functional design that is still inviting with clean lines and details. I really like the interiors of both cars. The Jaguar has the best leather and wood, but a few things like the plastic of the Audi's air vents seems more resilient, etc.

Road&Track said that, ""Despite the lower-than-XJ price, the X-TYPE sports the traditional Jaguar upscale cabin...The simple round gauges have an easy-on-the-eyes green backing on the instrument faces, there's birds-eye maple trim scattered around the cockpit, and the seats are tasteful and comfortable...The Jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges."" They say it ""may be an 'entry level' model, but you wouldn't know it judging by all that leather, wood, and the easy to use nav system.""

Motor Trend says the X-TYPE ""has great styling inside and out"", and says specifically that the interior is ""soothing, luxurious, and reasonably sound from an ergonomic standpoint. The main instruments are nicely detailed and easily readable through the steering wheel. HVAC and audio-system controls are housed in a centrally mounted horseshoe-shaped binnacle, which allows lots of genuine maple veneer to span the entire dash...It's pure Jag inside and out.""

Car&Driver says ""As you'd expect, the interior is lined in sumptuous Connolly leather and bird's-eye maple wood trim on the dashboard and doors. Luxury amenities abound, as well as the expected front, side, and head airbags...The level of finish is very nice with neat stitiching, close fits, and excellent materials throughout.""
_____________________________

eaweg-

My opinion is that the Audi and the Jaguar are both great cars, but that the Jaguar offers more. It is more expensive than the A4, but it is more expensive for a reason. It is known to outhandle the A4 and outperform it in acceleration and braking, and it has the most rigid chassis in its class, 30% more than the previous class leader. AWD is also standard, as well as Connolly leather and wood. You must have had a bad test car if yours felt like it was going to fall apart, because everything I have read and experienced with the X-TYPE says that it is very solid with high-quality materials throughout. Like you said, to each their own."

I have to be honest and say that it was the 'Quattro' that won me over as well as the excellent lease deal. My lease on the Audi was much better than that on the x-type as well.

""Quality problems bedevil Jaguar's X-Type; two drivetrain issues cited""

...Jaguar Cars Ltd. is at risk of alienating its newest group of owners, many of whom complain their new X-Type sedans have an array of irritating quality snafus. While none of the problems directly affect safety or operation, they are of sufficient annoyance that some first-time Jaguar buyers say they're ready to bolt the franchise...

...There are two separate drivetrain problems. During deceleration from about 70 mph, a high-pitched whine will come from the all-wheel-drive differential unit. That problem is so widespread that Jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its U.S. dealers.

The fix: adding mass to the differential-mounting bracket.

But the cold weather noise is another matter. It occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph. For some owners it goes away quickly; others have the tuning-fork sound ringing for minutes at a time.

This problem has been the most bothersome to owners because Jaguar Cars has not officially acknowledged it exists.

Some owners say they have had several prop-shafts replaced under warranty - one American owner says he is on his sixth.

Steven Miller, a 41-year-old attorney from Long Beach, N.Y., suffers from both drivetrain problems. While he says he loves his X-Type, Miller is frustrated by his dealer's inability to repair the problems, despite three visits to the service bay. ""I made a tape recording of the noise,"" Miller said. ""The attempted fix was to put some sort of additive into the all-wheel-drive system. This quieted the noise for several days, then it came back."" ...

75,cmnott,"June 28, 2002 4:41PM","Congrats on your A4!

Look, no question you were quite gracious about my comments about the A4. I was so disappointed with the new styling because I always wanted the previous A4. So to see how it looks, personally, I hate it. maybe it is just me, but I just couldn't come to grips with it.

I found the A4 felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes. but also felt smaller. i think it is unfair and untrue to say the ""Ford"" thing, I think that has been addressed, whether people choose to beleive it or not. The 6 speed was poor, there is no other word for it, but i really did enjoy the automatic (as far as one can).

the jaguar had a much, much better transmission but I was not particularly enamored with the clutch. the steering, IMO, was better than almost all. I just couldn't justify the price difference when a certain car is TRYING to make an impression in a hot segment.

Like i said before, there are no losers in this segment, but I think it is safe to say none of us would go for the winner of the comparo, eaweg and jagxboytype!"
76,jagboyxtype,"June 28, 2002 6:39PM","I totally agree that it is all personal preference, and I really believe that most all of the cars in this segment, especially the A4, S60, and X-TYPE, are some of the best. I don't think there is ""a best"" car here since everyone has different needs and preferences. They all have their own ups and downs, but I think the benefits of each of these cars certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well.

On the X-TYPE article:
I read that Autoweek article too, and it scared me a bit before I went to check out the X-TYPE and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end. Jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problems in the current X-TYPEs though, and the ones being produced now don't have any of those problems. I also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early X-TYPE problems. The initial article was much like the Autoweek one, and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one; it was a follow-up on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after Jaguar North America finally contacted them and worked on their cars. They had factory technicians go out and examine the cars and all of that - they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one. Jaguar was a bit late in contacting them (and I agree that it took too long), but they did get most all of their X-TYPEs fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their cars in the end.

Yes, some of the very early production X-TYPEs lived up to their old Jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows, but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability. Jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early cars, and they even had the Whitley Engineering Center, who designed the driveshafts for the X-TYPE, go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect.

I can personally say from experience that the X-TYPE is not in any way a problem car, at least the ones being produced now, especially as my own car has had no problems at all. It initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets, but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car, and nothing has gone wrong since I've had it. I really love even just being around the cars as it has been so good.

Again, it is all personal preference. When I sat in the Jag for the first time, it just felt right. I hadn't even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect. Every time I sit in it, everything is perfect. The whole car is that way for me, and I bet your Audi is the same for you.

And if anyone is paying off the media it's BMW and Infiniti, and it appears that Infiniti is paying the most. I don't think Jag even has the funds to do that:-) (Although, global sales were just up 62% in April, and they've had record-setting sales for the past four consecutive years now.)

And, it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board. Take care of your car!

Blueguydotcom-

I actually own my car, we paid the dealer in full when we got it. The only incentive for the X-TYPE is a pretty good lease price (I just checked yesterday), but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 2.5 litre model with no options (not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease!). It's also ending in a few months, and then prices will be even higher. I'd like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out, as they are even higher than this year. Oh well, it is a Jaguar after all, and a great car on its own. Option packaging has been reorganized for 2003, however, so getting things like sunroofs is easier."
77,blueguydotcom,"June 28, 2002 7:59PM","Is the Jag even selling? I see far more Bimmers, Lexuses, G35s and CTSes than Jag X-types. And i live in car crazy so-cal."
78,jagboyxtype,"June 29, 2002 12:48AM","The X-TYPE is Jaguar's fastest selling car right now, it accounts for over half of all Jaguar's sales, and it has boosted Jaguar's global sales by 62% since January 2002; and that number was recorded from April. In February of 2002, Jaguar's U.S. sales alone were up 105% compared to Feb. 2001, largely because of the X-TYPE. X-TYPE's sales have been taking off after a slower start since the events of 9-11.

Recorded in May, 16,171 X-TYPEs have been sold since January 1, 2002 in the U.S. Of that number, 2,961 were sold in May. Jaguar is very happy with its sales. Also, the X-TYPE is supposed to be lower volume than many of its competators as it is a Jaguar. Never the less, this compares well with 16,395 Audi A4s and 16,339 Volvo S60s sold so far this year. The Infiniti G35 has only sold 8,731 units so far, and 11,237 Cadillac CTS's have been sold in 2002 as well."
79,eaweg,"July 1, 2002 2:00AM","Thanks to you both for your great chats...I agree with jagboy that it's nice to see people talk about things without acting like ""my dad can beat up your dad""...my only knowledge from automobiles is that I have a passion for them. Mechanically I am okay...just enough to get by.

It's funny, after I got my Audi the Volvo dealer that's 5 miles form my house had a great deal one week later. Yes I was miffed for about 24 hours but like the both of you I think my personality fits my choice.

You are absolutely right about there not being a loser in this segment. For those who get the G35, more power to you...so you can beat me in a straight line...if racing was what I wanted I would have gotten a used S4 and modded it to about 340hp...but I really couldn't see myself doing that for at least the next 4 years of my life. For some reason I have a sneaking suspicion that something negative is going to come out about the G35...I just can't pinpoint it thought. The '02+ 3 series are just plain ugly with the new facelifts.

Cmnott, as for the 6 speed, yeah it was pretty ""odd"" the first couple of months. I can honestly say though that it has brolen in and that it is worlds better than when I first got it. To think that the 5spd manual in the 96 Saab 900se that I had before it was actually better!!

You said, ""The Infiniti G35 has only sold 8,731 units so far.""

I think it's important to point out the G35 has only been on the market since March 11. In the month of April, Infiniti sold over 3200 G35's.

I just want to make sure no one is misled by your post."
81,jagboyxtype,"July 2, 2002 7:05PM","My point was that the X-TYPE is selling and that there is a larger amount of them on the road right now than there are G35's or CTS's. Blueguydotcom had asked about its sales numbers and had compared how he had seen few X-TYPEs on the road but many more ""Bimmers, Lexuses, G35s and CTSes"". I just threw in the other cars' numbers to demonstrate that although he may have seen more of some of the other cars, in actuality, there are more X-TYPEs that what he has seen.

Also, Infiniti sold 3,298 G35's in May 2002. Since its introduction in March, it has sold 8,731 units as recorded in May. Assuming that around 3,298 units would have been sold in January and February had the car been introduced earlier and had a start in sales numbers for January 1 like the others, it would have sold about 15,327 units (3,298 + 3,298 + 8,731 = 15327)."

-The SportCross takes on the 3-Wagons. So do the A4 Avant, V70, C-Class wagons, and the soon to appear X-TYPE Touring.

-The S4 takes on the M3. There is also a C32 AMG. Later, the X-TYPE R will also join that crowd.

-The A4 Cabriolet takes sales from the 3-Convertibles.

-An A4 coupe is on the way, as is the G35 coupe to take one the coupe 3-Series. There are still IS300 coupe rumors, too. To a lesser extent, the C-Class coupe takes on the compact 3-Series in Europe.

And to top that off, the new Saab 9-3 is a sedan now with a normal trunk.

By your thinking: ""You could almost include the Z3 roadster in the mix, as it shares engines, transmissions, and platform parts"", I guess we should include the Camry in the ES300's sales volume since they share those same parts too. How about all of those Jettas, Passats, Beetles, and Golfs that come with that 1.8T engine in the A4? Maybe those should be included too."

I drove several '02 325xi's and A4 3.0 Quattro's, and both had their +/-'s. The 325, though, lacks even the most fundamental standard options (no power seats on a $30k+ car!?!?) and has a way to go on the interior design (cheesy exposed cup holders that look like they belong in a Pontiac). Not to mention the 325 has 30% less power to spin those 4 wheels.

The sad thing is that virtually all luxury sports sedan reviews compare a $40k+ loaded 330 with a $33k A4, and the 325 is declared the de facto winner as it rides on the tails of the 330. The whole ""3-series"" nomenclature is nonsense.

93,rpawlak98,"September 15, 2002 12:42AM","I beleive the handling of the BMW is slightly better because of it's small size. I would like to see how it would handle if it were a midsize car (like the Infiniti G35 or Acura TL).

The amount of 'points' that are giving to the BMW for it's handling should be removed for it's size. This is a sedan! It is not a sports car. When talking about sedans, sufficient room in the car should be seen as an important factor.

I'm sure they could make the BMW even smaller and get even better handling and performance from it. If they did that, it would be hard to justify it even being in this category."
94,kdshapiro,"September 15, 2002 3:18AM","rp - you are correct the 330i is a sedan, just like the G35, just like the Acura, just like the Audi and all of the cars that were compared in the latest Edmunds round-up. None of them are sports cars. Edmunds calls them Entry Level Luxury Sport Sedans. The fact is the 530i also gets very high marks in the performance department, except the 530i is a true Luxury Sport Sedan, again not a sports car.

Now the 530i outclasses all of the above in terms of amenities, but it would be interesting to see from a strict performance viewpoint, how it compares to the above or even compares to the 330i.

Although in the scheme of things size has little to do with performance - as another poster pointed out there are cars the same size as the 330i that are nowhere near it in terms of overall performance. Note the salient word is overall.

Also the fact that it is a compact has nothing to do with it's interior room. The G does not have marginally much more room and if you read Edmunds round-up, it does state there is sufficient room in the car for 4 adults in the 330i. Unless you regularly transport 5 people and the two people in the back seat absolutely have to have the reclining seats, in my opinion the amount of extra space in the G doesn't make that much of a difference. It might to you, but then you get to vote with your dollars. If I regularly transported 5 people however, none of the cars in the Edmunds round-up would be on my list.

It seems clear to me based on the reviews I've read over the last couple of years, when only talking about the sport of driving in this segment, the 330i is the benchmark."

Here are my thoughts, and I'd appreciate comments from others:

325i pros
fun to drive and handles well
like the sound of the inline 6-cyl. engine
holds its value well
nice safety features
good reliability record

many on the road
styling not that exciting any more

Mercedes C240 pros
styling (in my opinion)
solid as a vault
nice ride and handling
safety features

C240 Cons
slightly underpowered
quality concerns (at least from early models)

Passat GLX pros
great looks
cheaper than BMW or Mercedes
decent power and handling
safety

Passat GLX cons
dealer service (from what I've heard)
seats not the best (in my opinion)
soft ride (i.e. not a ""sports sedan"")"
97,kdshapiro,"September 16, 2002 7:29PM","Add the following cons to the Mercedes and VW:

- in my area there are many on the road, diminishing the value.

Seriously - I think you have to focus on what's important to you. Is fun to drive, hold's value and good safety features important? Or is styling important and the fact there are many on the road an important criteria because you want a unique vehicle.

Just as a suggestion, if you phrased the question differently rather than giving your opinion about the importantance of certain car attributes you might get some very meaningful responses.

For me important questions might be:

1. Has anybody had any reliability issues with any of these cars? How did the dealers respond?
2. What do others think about the seating in the vehicles?
3. How much did people pay?

Good luck with your decision."

I'm finding that it's very hard to judge reliability from the internet message boards. I've read horror stories on the internet for all three cars. People with problems are more likely to post a message than those without problems. Consumer Reports recommends all three cars. I personnally know one person with a C240 and one with a C320 wagon. Both love their cars, but haven't had them too long.

I made a mistake with my current car and am determined not to do it again. I want to get something I don't mind paying for, want to keep for many years, and want to keep shiny. The problem is all three of these are great cars."

The Passat is a real bargain with the nicest and largest interior as well as elegant exterior styling. I looked hard at a GLX and W8 when I was shopping. The handling is pretty wallowing, and the power is just adequate (I'm a leadfoot ).

The 325i is fun and rewarding to drive, really nice handling and ergonomics. Its pretty small and the price goes up fast as you add options, and its also underpowered for my taste.

I've never driven the C240. The C320 I drove was nice, but not terribly sporty and I was disappointed in the quality of some of the interior pieces (they need to see where VW gets their switches).

All three a very good cars, I could be happy with any of them based on my needs."

101,techhawk,"September 17, 2002 1:55AM","The TL-S does have boring styling and white is its worst color. It fairs better in darker colors. The overall performance is similar to the G35, though it gets edged out in most categories. The biggest difference is FWD vs. RWD. I spent quite a bit of time in a TL-S when shopping recently. I chose a G35, but if you are a Honda fan or prefer FWD the TL-S is a great choice. It will also run you a little less than a comparably equipped G35, and you can probably get a deeper discount to boot. There have been concerns about the TL-S having tranny failures, but Acuras tend to be very reliable.

For direct comparisons of the G35 and TL-S look at the recent Edmunds entry sport lux sedan comparo, the C/D currently on news stands (I have to admit its not very credible to me) and the July 2002 R/T. Good luck with your shopping."

Sedan, coupe, convertible, wagon, and ultra-high performance models. AWD and RWD. Automatic and manual. Choice of engines. Is it BMW's fault they are so wise to spread their costs across so many variants and give buyers so many choices? I say you could also add Z3 sales to the mix, too!"
109,jagboyxtype,"September 22, 2002 1:13AM","Oh, that's too bad. It's also too bad that they failed to notice that:

-The X-TYPE does have an indash CD-player, which is standard on 3.0 litre models.

-Out of the group of European sport sedans (e.g. BMW 3, Mercedes-Benz C, Audi A4) the Jaguar X has the most powerful engines.

-The Jaguar Alpine sound system is rated very highly. The auto's section of my newspaper rated the Jaguar Alpine system the top system out of premium European cars in a big comparison test of car stereos. Lexus won the Japanese premium car sound system category with its ML system.

-The car is a wonderful handler; for example, it outperformed the C-320 Sport in that deleted post comparison, and although it does not have the class-leading acceleration times, it is only about 0.2 second behind the 3-Series and is in the top end of its class when it comes to performance (0-60 in 6.3 seconds - Car&Driver; 0-60 in 6.5 seconds - Road&Track). With its AWD, it can corner like no other car.

-Braking performance from 60mph is just two feet longer than the Porsche 911 GT2 (116 feet), at 118 feet. Thus, it stops in the same distance as a smaller BMW M-Roadster (118 ft.). Brakes are from the larger S-TYPE.

-Connoly leather and wood are all standard in the Jag, and leather and wood are only optional (if available) in competor's models.

-It has the most rigid structure in its class, over 30% higher than the previous class leader.

-Synthetic interior materials (e.g. plastics and not-leather soft-touch areas) are made by the same company from the same materials from the same machines that manufacture synthetic materials for Audi's A6 and new A8, which are ""industry leading"" according to many.

-The X-TYPE does weigh a little more than a RWD car as it carries an extra differential and drive shaft for its AWD, but that doesn't seem to hurt its performance. It actually helps it in many ways. Also, for instance, it weighs less than an Audi A4, Cadillac CTS, and Lincoln LS.

-There is some engine noise entering the cabin, but even wispers are still audible from passengers. Plus, it's a sports-sedan, so the engine is supposed to have a nice little note to it. Many reviewers have enjoyed the sound the X-TYPE's engine makes. There is also almost no wind noise as exterior mirrors, etc. were sculpted from windtunnel tests at Pininfarina and high-speed tests on the Nardo bowl in Italy as well as the Nurburgring in Germany.

-Clutch: yes, some people dislike its feel, yet others like it because it is not difficult to use. I believe that it was MotorWeek that stated it felt like a BMW clutch.

-Pricing: you can get a base X-TYPE for around $29,000 - $30,000 with leather and wood, manual transmission, metallic paint, etc. Option packages have been re-organized to allow more individual options to be ordered. Competators like the MB C-Class sedan start at around $31,000 without leather and wood, but vinyl and plastic.

About the only virtue the X-TYPE doesn't have are memory seats. Beyond those, it's one hellofa car. I doubt it would still be making up 56.7% of Jaguar's sales and dominating an unheard-of 66% of its market in Europe (especially Italy) if it weren't a great car.

On the Acura transmission problems, only 16,000 cars have been afficted with the problem over the past two years, according to the posted article. Accura sells a lot of cars, so it does not seem to be a massive or wide-spread problem. Hopefully they'll fix it, but I wouldn't worry about it too much."
110,riez,"September 22, 2002 2:57AM",jagboyxtype... Have you been reading what European Car has been writing? I'd encourage you to read their articles. They have a web site. I didn't write them. Please don't shoot me. I just passed along what an interesting source said. I happen to agree with many of their comments. Not all. And I hope Jaguar works aggressively to improve the X-type.
111,jagboyxtype,"September 22, 2002 3:47AM","""Please don't shoot me.""

I wasn't trying to shoot you. You are just being paranoid. I never even mentioned you in my whole response except for in the title where I was directing my message to what had been said that you passed along. I said ""they"" as in the editors of European Car, but if you are now using the ""royal we"" and took what I said as directed towards you, now you know that is not how it was meant. I will shoot some words at you about improving the X-TYPE, however, as I don't feel the car needs any improving at all except in a very few minor areas, such as memory seats (not that they are really needed, but it would be a nice touch). Everything that makes a Jag is there in the X-TYPE, and it is a great car on its own. Naturally, Jaguar will improve the X-TYPE just as it improves all of its cars. As for your fear of being shot at with words on this board, perhaps you shouldn't say things that would cause you to get shot at if that is a fear of yours.

BTW, every month, over 3,000 people just in the U.S. disagree with you and with European Car about the X-TYPE. Sorry buddy, but you're in the minority on this one. However, European Car's own final words on their X-TYPE test were:

""Pushed to the limit and the X-Type will gently push until you ease off the throttle. Muscled around the track however, and its possible to slide the sedan until the tires melt. Great fun!

I came away from the X-Type totally surprised. I expected to find a meek and mild sedan but instead found a serious contender in the sport-sedan market. These first two offerings are great!...I can't wait to see what those rouges at Jag's R division have in store for the X-Type."""

113,riez,"September 22, 2002 1:08PM","jagboyxtype... Ya gotta stay calm. Did you notice in your most recent post you did write ""over 3,000 people just in the US disagree with YOU and with European Car about the X-type.""

Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written? The X-type has gotten mixed reviews at best in America. Don't believe it has ""won"" a single comparison test. See R&T's recent 11-car sport sedan comparison. Think that says a ton when X-type falls short badly in comparison tests.

Can you steer me to an American comparison test in which the X-type won?

And what do sales have to do with how truly good a sport sedan is? I see a lot of people driving Malibu, Taurus, I30, ES300, etc. To many (most!) people a car is either an appliance or a status symbol. But it is only the rare few who are truly interested in all around performance. Some people might argue that low sales are a better indicator. Most people want cushy ride on interstate, not 0-60 times or slalom results. The IS300 crowd might wear their low sales as a badge of honor."
114,riez,"September 22, 2002 1:26PM","jagboyxtype... Do you read MT or R&T?

Check out the November 2001 issue of Motor Trend. MT pans the X-type 3.0 AUTOMATIC in their 5-car comparison. In 10 areas of their ""Report Card"", the Jag wins just one, styling. Has last place or 2nd to last place rating in powertrain, ride, interior design, seat comfort/support, rear-cabin space, trunk useability, and value. Track results mediocre. Fourth place 0-60 mph time. 2nd slowest slalom time. Worst braking result. They tested a moderately loaded $43,695 one.

Check out the July 2002 issue of Road & Track. R&T pans the X-type 3.0 MANUAL in their 11-car comparison. X-type comes in 10th overall, 9th in just subjective ratings, and 10th in just performance ratings. They tested a loaded $46,510 one.

Does that mean you disagree with me, European Car, R&T, and MT? Wonder if you and the other 3,000 people are reading what is out there? And test driving the X-type against its competitors?"
115,merc1,"September 22, 2002 3:10PM","Isn't that comparo a little bit much? I mean how does a ""almost a 1/2 second"" = ""throat raming"" or ""pummelling"" ? I would expect the Jaguar to be faster with a stick and the Benz with an auto. I have nothing against the X-Type, but that test is a little thick in my opinion.

One other thing: Who says the X-Type has the most rigid structure in this class? I've read that the C320 Sport, 330i and especially the A4 all have very stout structures. This has also been my experience in driving all three of them.

116,riez,"September 22, 2002 9:29PM","jagboyxtype... Check out the February 2002 issue of Car and Driver. 7 car comparison. X-type 3.0 MANUAL came in 5th place.

C&D's X-type was pretty basic, with only a $39,170 MSRP.

Notice the trend, all the tested X-type's had stickers of $39,000 and up, and most publications harp that the Jag fails to deliver the goods for so many dollars.

Pushing $40,000 does NOT seem to be entry-level to me. The X-type 2.5 is more the entry-level Jaguar."

118,jagboyxtype,"September 23, 2002 10:52AM","Merc1-

The X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the BMW 3-Series. You may check out AutoWeek's review of the car for that information, as well as a review on the site autobytel.com and reviews conducted by Autocar including their ""Autocar Book"" all about the X-TYPE. I never said that any of those cars you mentioned didn't have very solid and rigid structures nor did I try to imply that, but at the moment, the Jaguar has the most rigid structure in its class.

Also, as riez would say, ""I did not write the article"". The reviewers were the ones who said all of those quotes about the X-TYPE beating the C-Class in every part of that test, and not just acceleration times. Take braking (""top drawer"" for the X-TYPE), or how they said the cars felt when being driven.
____________________________________

Riez-

I pity you, because you only believe what car magazines tell you, and you allow them to choose for you what is best instead of collecting your own information and actually checking things out for yourself. Listen to what you've been sayin: ""Car & Driver said this, and MotorTrend said this, and Road & Track said this"". Granted, I have used their quotes and stats many times to back my own opinions as well (which I even do here), but you've taken it to an extreme.

""Do you read MT or R&T?"" you ask me.
Sometimes I do, but only for entertainment purposes. Why? Because I do not trust them, do not believe everything they say, and only take what they have to say as their own human opinions. And I am not the only one who feels that way. ABC News, for instance, did an investigation on the subject of car magazines being biased and omitting facts to suit their own interests. They use the Ford Focus and Car&Driver and MotorTrend's opinions of the car as an example:

""For example, in January, Car and Driver listed the Ford Focus among its '10 Best Cars of the Year.' It never mentioned that Ford had recalled the Focus eight times for various problems when that review was written [one such recall was because the wheels would fall off of the car!]. Also, just this month, when Motor Trend's review came out — no mention of the recalls or the fact that the government has five ongoing safety-related investigations of the Focus. (It currently has six ongoing investigations, but only five that Motor Trend could have known of when it went to press.)""
http://www.abcnews.com

Hmmm. Six government safety investigations, eight major recalls in its few years of production, and the Focus is a favorite among car magazines like Car&Driver and MotorTrend. Well, they can have it, and I'm sure you think it's a wonderful little car since everything they say suddenly becomes law for you.

ABC also mentions how certain car manufacturers that give all-expense paid trips to reviewers get higher scores and better reviews when the reviewers handle their cars. Even an auto reviewer interviewed in the article said ""there are other subtle ways that automakers try to woo the press"". MotorTrend's own C. Van Tune admitted to utilizing these perks from certain auto makers although his magazine has the resources to pay for these trips, etc. on its own.

The warning at the end of the article reads: ""So far, the big magazines don't seem to have changed their policies. So, be aware: When you read and see reviews of this year's models, some of those reviews were written by reporters who've been fed and fueled by the car companies.""

It can be expected that comparison tests would be especially succeptible to the effects of biases and perks from some automakers. This is why you cannot believe and trust car magazines for anything more than entertainment and a very few facts.

""Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written?"" you also ask me. Yes, I have. European Car's own review of the X-TYPE is nothing short of pure flattery towards the car. Road&Track's review of the X-TYPE is also very complementary. Car&Driver tested the X-TYPE's 0 - 60 time as just 6.3 seconds and raved about ""enthusiast goods"" of the car. MotorTrend enjoyed the car very much, and bought their own long-term tester, of which they say ""This new X is one shaggy Jaggy"" and ""I'm anxious to try out the upcoming R version of the X-TYPE, because this is a very good sport sedan"". AutoWeek liked the car and decided that ""X"" was definitely an addition to the ""A"", ""C"", and ""3"" in the sport sedan equation. Forbes wrote a very fine review of the car. A vast majority of other reviews, such as those at carpoint and autobytel are also complementary to the X-TYPE. And again, Autocar was so inspired that they created a minibook about the ""Most Important Jaguar Ever"" and said that between it and a 330i, they don't know which one they would choose - ""it's that close"".

You mention ""American"" tests in your posts. I must also ask you, however, why you believe that any reviews or comparison tests about the X-TYPE from any other parts of the world are suddenly invalid? They are all reviews, how come only the ones you choose count? There are people from all over the world here at Edmunds, are their views and opinions also invalid to you because they do not live in the same country as you do?

On the matter of that Road&Track 11 car comparison, the reviewers say:
""So how, you ask, did a car as nice as the Jaguar X-TYPE end up second to last in this great big comparison test? That's easy: Price.""
Notice that they happened to also have loaded their X-TYPE with every option available on the car including such expensive items as the navigation system, weather package, and premium sound system, etc. Yet, other cars in their test were not fully loaded as the Jaguar was. The BMW, for instance, was lacking its navigation system and other items, the Mercedes-Benz (the second most expensive car in the group at $44,949) also without its navigation system and lacking its premium sound system (and in fact left without a CD player that no one seems to complain about not having in this car for this price, where as the Jaguar can take heat for having just a single-disc indash unit when not equipped with the 6-disc changer). A test with price included is not valid unless all cars are optioned out with the same equipment. The X-TYPE had much more than any of the other cars in the test did. A better comparison for price would have been to compare base prices of the cars or prices of options, or get this: equip the cars similarly. Take note that both the Saab and the Mercedes-Benz have higher starting prices than the Jaguar, and that the Jag's starting price is about $1,500-$2,000 above most of the other cars in the test, and that it comes standard with wood and leather which costs about $1,500-$2,000 to equip on the other cars. AWD is also standard on the Jag, and extra-cost options on the cars that can have it equipped. La"
119,jagboyxtype,"September 23, 2002 10:54AM","<continued>Later in that same R&T issue, they happen to have purchased, out of all those cars, a long-term X-TYPE.

Also, on price, let's not complain about the X-TYPE when Road&Track's $39,804 (and I count that as near $40,000, wouldn't you?) BMW 330i does not even come with power seats in another comparo (page 74 of their ""Road Test Annual 2002"").


So what else did R&T say about the X-TYPE in that 11 car test? How about ""Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work. It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners. Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkie-talkies we all carry and said, 'This thing is really good in the curves.' It's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. The engine is not bad either...our test car's optional 3.0-litre 4-cam V-6 put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort...Overall, the X-TYPE is a comfortable, pleasent and useful car with a well-developed chassis...It's a good all-rounder with, probably just as much British charm as most modern drivers really want. Independent of price, it scored in about the middle of our group in performance and subjective ratings."" As a side note, they also say, ""The Jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges. Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivered surprisingly good handling"". http://www.roadandtrack.com


And most of its other reviews have said pretty much the same things about the car as stated above: good handling, nice styling, comfortable interior. Yeah, there are some bad reviews, but there are many many more good ones, and it doesnt't get ""panned"" as you have continually been repeating.


Let's also not overlook the TOP GEAR 2002 Motoring Survey, in which ""over 37,000 motorists"" were spoken to about 120 car models and 33 manufacturers. The rankings for the entry-level cars were:

1.) Lexus IS 200

2.) Jaguar X-TYPE

3.) BMW 3-Series

4.) Mercedes-Benz C-Class

5.) Audi A4 and A4 Avant (wagon)

6.) Saab 9-3

7.) Volvo S40 and V40 (wagon)

8.) Alfa Romeo 156


They had little quotes by some of the cars. The X-TYPE's read: ""Just past its first anniversary and the X-Type enters the survey three places ahead of the BMW 3-Series [out of the total 120 cars]. Great dealer service, few problems and good dynamics see to that.""


Let's not argue here though riez. We both have opinions, and I simply don't agree with yours. Hostilities aside, have a great day! :-)

The whole Jaguar/Ford thing died a long time ago. X-TYPE shares 6 points on its platform with the Mondeo - not even its entire platform, and it shares no body panels with any other car. Anyone could just as easily say that your A4 is just a Jetta with four rings on its grille.

I think the Xtype still has a way to go as far as I go, before I ever would consider one to be a class leader.

While you have a private debate going with riez - my two cents you buy what you buy for the reasons you buy, but the trades and mags of barometers. You have to read them, understand where they intersect with your beliefs and opinions and take it from there.

In addition, a $40K 330i is almost loaded and a base 330i can be had for $32K at ED plus air-fare."

MSRP fully loaded: $45,235

This was done at the BMW U.S. website. It's a little higher than that $40K estimate of yours. My point is not to single out the 3 for high pricing, but to demonstrate that while a nicely equipped one can be had for around $40,000, like any other car in its class, it carries a high price when totally fully loaded. This is my point about the X-TYPE in the 11 car R&T comparison: a nicely equipped one (similarly equipped with that $40,000 3 in the test) can be had for around $40,000, but the editors instead chose to get a totally fully loaded one and then mark it down for a high price. It wasn't quite fair. Totally fully loaded, the Mercedes-Benz would have been the most expensive car in the test by quite a margin. Ever notice how the E-Class starts at around $50,000, but the S-TYPE and 5-Series start at around $42,000?

As far as class leaders go, I believe that all of the cars in this class are very good, and that they target slightly different groups. X-TYPE and C-Class have more luxury than the others, G35 and 3-Series are a little more performance oriented, but all of them share many traits with slight variances in the degrees of those traits.

It's nice to hear from you! We haven't talked for a while. Happy driving!"
122,riez,"September 23, 2002 1:40PM","jagboyxtype... I merely pointed out how when the American automotive press has had a chance to test the X-type up against its main competitors, it falls flat. Pretty much every single American comparison test.

Why do I bring up American tests? Because I cannot buy a Euro-spec X-type in America. And many of the European cars a Euro-spec X-type is compared against in these tests aren't even sold in America. Besides marques like Fiat, SEAT, Alfa, Lancia, etc. Heck I can't even spell the French marques that are no longer sold in USA: Renault and Peugueot. Been so long since since I've even seen an old French-marque car in my neighborhood.

So ensuring all the cars are USA-spec is critical to a legitimate comparison.

And I've always loved the pro-Brit bias in the English car magazines. They do whatever they can to say nice things about English cars. I leaf thru their mags at my local Borders and Barnes & Noble. The German press has raved about the underlying Ford Mondeo platform. Mondeo built in Germany."

I have hard time believe they did a specific testing of each of these cars structures to determine that. The A4 is the one I felt was the most solid. As far as that test goes, I think it was basically set up to show up any weakness the C320 may have.I don't think a 1/2 second is stomping anything into the ground, and the Jag should have been faster considering it was a manual. Beating the C-Class at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn't what the car focuses on primarily. I'd be more impressed with a ""pumeling"" by the X-Type of the 330i or IS300 in those areas.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think the X-Type is a bad car, but that test had more than a twinge of bs to it.

To me it's fully loaded because there is nothing else I wanted and I belive the Navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. If you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.

People have different requirments for what they want in a car. We have to be careful between comparing the MSRP of fully optioned cars, because most people do not order them that way. The base 330i with leatherette can be had at ED for a mere $32,000.

They say, ""This particular parts-sharing, it turns out, only gives the Jag its chassis 'hard points' and its engine blocks, but not much else. Jaguarites say the chassis itself shares only six small panels with its blue-oval counterpart, and that their version has been reinforced significantly for stiffness and quiet. In fact, they boast, by the time the leaper hood ornament goes on the car, its static rigidity is 30 percent better than that of the nearest luxury segment competitor. By another measure, body stiffness comes in at 22 kg/degree vs. the 21 kg/degree recorded by the BMW 3 Series, a mighty fine measuring stick to use."" <--See, they measured it.</b>

Other reviews have noted that it has the most rigid structure in its class, I can find them and post their URLs if you'd like, if this review is not proof enough.

Also, if the link doesn't work because the site is a sign-in type, go to autoweek.com and use their search box, typing in ""Jaguar X-type"".

BTW: I do think that X-TYPE v. C-Class review was also a little ""BS""-ed, however, I believe all comparison reviews are either a little biased or include some BS, as you can read about in my long posts a few messages away. However...

You say ""Beating the C-Class at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn't what the car focuses on primarily.""

Isn't the C-Class supposed to compete with the IS300, 330i, and X-TYPE? Why is it that when the X-TYPE does win, excuses can be made for the other car(s), with ""they don't focus on those areas""? I'm willing to invalidate the transmissions in the this test as they were not totally evenly matched there, but the X-TYPE won out every other category of the test as well: Engine, brakes, ride... I could just as easily say that the X-TYPE doesn't focus on those areas either, but no one would back me and it really is a poor excuse. You also note that 1/2 second is not ""stomping anything to the ground"", yet in the Road&Track 11-car test, the X-TYPE was just 0.6 second slower than the fastest car in the test, and it was marked down for that. We can't suddenly make an exception for this test. I could say that the X-TYPE doesn't focus on acceleration in the R&T review, but again that is a poor excuse. If we choose to accept the R&T 11 car test, then we must, by principle, accept this test as well. In those regards, the X-TYPE v. C-Class comparison was quite valid.

Take care!

Riez-

I think I'll terminate this discourse now that we have both had our say. It's just going to continue in a perpetual loop if we don't stop. But...

I noticed that you still say the car falls flat, and in all of those comparisons, you have said yourself that price was a major factor in the car's losing points, as well as R&T, C&D, and others noting that. I'm just wondering if you read my really long message a ways back, as I outlined how the X-TYPE in all of those tests was outfitted much more heavily with options than any of the other cars and that its price would have been closer to the others had the X-TYPE been outfitted with the same options as the others in the test. Also, as merc1 notes, 1/2 second differences, etc. are not large gaps. Being 0.6 second off from the fastest car in the test, and 0.5 from the winning car is not ""falling flat"" by any means.

You seem to fail to notice actual measurements and what the reviewers write about the cars, and instead only look at points and scores. Take note of the ""luggage space"" scores for the cars in the R&T 11 car test, for instance. The X-TYPE has a boot capacity of 16.0 cubic feet. For that, it received 7.8 out of 10 possible points in that category. Now look at the Cadillac CTS with a boot capacity of 12.8 cubic feet. Yet it received 8.4 points out of the 10, and it had a smaller boot. The Infiniti G35 has 14.8 cubic feet of boot space, yet even with less space than the X-TYPE, it received the same score of 7.8 out of 10. The 330i, with only 10.7 cubic feet of boot space received 7.6 points, only 0.2 less point than the X-TYPE with 5.3 more cubic feet than the 330i. These ratios aren't right, and I cannot help but feel that their other points and scores must also be affected by these kinds of discrepancies.

I also still disagree with you about European or other comparison tests not being valid. Included in these tests are cars such as the X-TYPE, C-Class, and A4, et al, that are sold in the U.S., as well as cars that are not available here. Just because a car is not U.S.-spec doesn't mean the test is totally invalid. In those other countries especially, those tests are very valid (as far as comparison tests go). It is not a question of whether or not the test is valid just to you, rather, it is a matter of how valid the test is as a fair test. That's where the problem is, you are choosing which tests you want to acknowledge and which you simply feel like leaving out. Besides, the difference between a U.S.-spec car and a non-U.S.-spec car is not going to come out in the test unless the car is crash tested or has an engine choice unavailable in the U.S., etc. You can get a general idea still, and to simply say that because it is not a test conducted by an American magazine is a bit ignorant. Especially as all of these cars are global cars.

You also claim that English reviews have a bias towards British cars and that the Germans also are biased. However, I have found that those two groups especially are very picky about cars and will tear a car apart worse than any American reviewer would dare to. The British also have a thing for BMW's - a German car - and I've not found a review where they had a bias for Jaguar or any other British car, and if they were biased and I missed it, they certainly could not be any more biased than any American editors.

Perhaps you have not noticed the bias that American reviewers have for German and Japanese cars? I believe Edmunds stated something about their ""infatuation"" with ""everything German"" in a Mercedes review, and the idea that Japanese cars are so much more reliable than any other cars is also overplayed to the point of now being a bias of American writers (and don't attempt to say that I'm saying that Japanese cars are not reliable now, because they are, I'm simply pointing out that there is an American bias of believing that they are tremendously more reliable than any other kind of car)."

You said ""I don't know what car you speced out but it's not my car. I don't deem a Nav system a must on a fully loaded car. I am talking about leather, sport and most high end options. My 330i does not have sport, nav or xenon, but if I did it again, I might have gotten sport. To me it's fully loaded because there is nothing else I wanted and I belive the Navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. If you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.""

That's exactly what I was trying to prove about the X-TYPE in its tests. Take, for instance, the Road&Track 11 car comparo. The X-TYPE had every option available including the unnecessary navigation system and other equipment that the majority of other cars did not have. It has been that way in almost every comparison test: the editors choose a fully loaded (as in every single available option) X-TYPE and then mark the car down for being expensive in comparison to competitors that are not fully loaded.

You are totally correct, NO ONE ever totally and fully loads out their car with every available option, but the reviewers all do for the X-TYPE in its comparison tests. They don't for the other cars. Even that second-most-expensive-car in the test C320 Sport was still not fully loaded, it didn't even have a CD player, as I mentioned before in my other message. In the magazines, they depict the X-TYPE as costing $46,000 all of the time. A base X-TYPE 2.5 with standard Connoly leather, wood trim, and manual transmission can be had at $29,000. Make the car a 3.0 litre model, and you get everything in the base model plus standard indash CD player and other goodies, and your choice of manual or automatic transmission at no extra cost, for $35,000. Nicely equipped, a 2.5 is usually around $33,000. A nicely equipped 3.0 is around $38,000.

In my other message, I wasn't trying to talk about your car. I was using the 3-Series as an example of how in the tests they'll get a nicely equipped one at $39,000 - $40,000, but that the car's fully loaded price is $45,000, just as they only showed the X-TYPE's fully loaded price of about $46,000, when one that is nicely equipped is between $38,000 - $40,000 just like the other cars."

130,riez,"September 24, 2002 7:35PM","jagboyxtype... Maybe we'll have something to discourse about when Ford improves the future Mondeo X-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class. As it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. Sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat. But I don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges. (Oops, think I meant to say when Jag improves the future X-type. )

And I'll really, really start worrying about and paying attention to European magazine results when Euro-spec cars are sold here. But today I can NOT even buy them. Think you should keep in mind that they often have many differences with their American counterparts (e.g., safety equipment, engines--they love diesels, transmissions) and there are tons of marques in Europe that are absent in America (Alfa, Fiat, Lancia, SEAT, Renault, Peugeout, Skoda, etc.)"
131,jagboyxtype,"September 25, 2002 12:58AM","Riez-

You missed the target again. The trunk space example was simply an example of how the points awarded to certain aspects of the cars in the tests do not tell the whole truth, as you misguidedly seem to believe. The fact of the matter is that the X-TYPE had more boot space than the other cars I mentioned, and it recieved less points than they did and in an unbalanced ratio, and that other scoring categories were similarly affected. You also failed to notice the phrases ""For example"" and ""For instance"" leading into what I was saying in many cases if you believe that boot space was all that I was speaking about.

You said of the X-TYPE's large boot ""And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges.""

From this I can tell that you never actually take the time to examine a car for yourself before passing judgement on it, but instead rely completely upon little comparison test articles and your own assumptions, as the X-TYPE does have multi-link boot hinges as opposed to the swan-neck hinges on such cars as the XJ8 and ES300, ect. that you assumed it had, and then stated it had as if it were a fact. But what can I expect from someone who finds himself clever at falsely mistaking a car for one with which it shares a few parts that cannot even be seen?

And on that topic, in the global car world of today, every car shares parts with another or many others. *FOR EXAMPLE* (<--if you miss it this time, I don't know what to do), BMW uses General Motors-sourced automatic transmissions and parts are shared with Mini. Volkswagen and Audi, Seat, Skoda, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti all share many <i>many parts. DaimlerChrysler and Mercedes-Benz share some parts now too, as well as sharing parts with Hyundai and Mitsubishi. Making fun of that seems, well, kind of pathetic - unless you have a weird sense of humor. They share parts; yeah - so what? It's not really relevant.

And as I noted about reviews and comparisons from other countries, the cars do have some differences from U.S.-spec cars (as you and I had noted that engines can be different, etc.) but a general idea of the car can be had from those tests - as I had also said before in my other message. Quite often, those tests even use the versions of the cars equipped with engines that are sold with them in the U.S., as we generally have the larger versions of the engines available to us. If it's a diesel-engine test, they usually also have the whole test based upon that fact and will call it a ""Diesel Showdown!"" or something else to that same effect. Again (for now the second time), you cannot simply invalidate a test because it was not conducted in America. The cars we are disputing are not even built in America. And many times, the versions of the cars used in the tests are for the most part equivalent to their U.S.-spec versions. Alpha Romeos, Fiats, Renaults, and Vauxhalls are not sold in America, and thus I understand saying that for use in America, their tests would be for the most part inconcequential; but Audis, Jaguars, BMWs, and Mercedes are all sold in the U.S. as well as foreign countries, and those foreign versions of the cars have little difference from their U.S.-spec versions as far as any test categories can gauge. They never crash-test the cars in these comparisons, and as C. Van Tune pointed out in the ABC article about how reviewers are ""fed and fueled"" by certain car manufacturers, safety isn't an exciting enough category for these tests, so to those reviewers who write about them, it is irrelevant. Safety equipment is usually the primary difference between U.S.-spec and foreign versions of the same cars, but that's not going to show-up in one of these car comparisons because they are not comprehensive enough at all to measure such things. Yet it's not just foreign articles that you are saying are invalid, though. You are just choosing the ones that back your arguement to the slightest degree, which again just a display of your ignorance.

As well as the boot-hinge thing that you got wrong (remember, X-TYPE has the multi-link hinges with auto-opening gas struts, not swan-neck hinges), you also said that it had a cramped rear seat in comparison to its competators. In comparison to a long-wheelbase Maybach, it is cramped, yes. However, it has one of the larger rear seats in its class. Not only is it larger than the BMW 3-Series' rear seat as well as the IS300's and A4's, but it is also larger than the midsize 5-Series' rear seat (but I'll admit not by that much compared to the 5). In posts in other sections of the Town Hall, you defend how large the 5-Series' rear seat is and how comfortable it is for adult passengers as far as roominess goes, why do you call the X-TYPE's rear seat - which is even larger than the 5's - ""cramped"". Is this yet ANOTHER ASSUMPTION that you made about the X-TYPE?

By now I am sure that you have noticed that I have continually refered to things in this message that I have already spoken about in my other two posts addressed to you a few messages back. I'm wondering if you really even read them since your arguements are always the same, and now you're even making outright assumptions. No matter what I say and no matter how many facts I back my statements with, you seem to have your eyes closed to them and don't even take them into account. Not only that, but your statements are generally incorrect and your assumptions don't even touch on facts or reality.

And I'd say the best selling Jaguar in history is competative when it makes up 56.7% of Jaguar's U.S. sales and holds an astonishing 66% of the entry-level to mid luxury segment in Europe, as well as over 70% of Jaguar's sales in its third largest market, Italy. Was your statement about being competative just another assumption on your part?

Maybe we'll actually have a discussion when you start taking note of what's actually going on with the car and stop making assumptions and false remarks. Good day."
132,merc1,"September 25, 2002 6:27AM","Ok, I read all that. So I'm supposed to believe Jaguar's claim over what every other brand claims right? Until I see an independent test of all of the cars in this class structural rigidity, I'll go by what feels the most solid, and it isn't the Jaguar X-Type. So we disagree there.
Secondly, everyone knows full well that the C-Class is not on the same plane with the 330i and IS300 when it comes to being ""sporty"". To impress me you'd have to beat those cars at all the track tests. Beating a C320 at the track isn't hard, the IS300 and 330i rule there. That acceleration test will never count in my book because of the trans difference.

I'm not saying the comparison as a whole was not valid, but I still maintain that they picked the areas in which the X-Type would winout. And Lastly the X-Type has been ranked below the C in every OTHER comparo done. If it were such a slaughter I'd think it would win some test over here too.

Again my point was that the boot space example was an example of how the points awarded in such comparison tests do not give real data. Points and scores are skewed - or whatever adjective you would use to describe awarding more space with less points in a category that is all about having more space.

""And did you notice how I was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans?""

Yes, I did catch that phrase the first time I read it. However, your argument against the X-TYPE in you message before the last was that it had a cramped rear seat and had swan-neck boot-lid hinges - both statements that were false. And now your latest statement that you did not name the X-TYPE directly when speaking of such things as boot-space and rear-seat room really is a weak cover-up.

You stated: ""Maybe we'll have something to discourse about when Ford improves the future Mondeo X-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class. As it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. Sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat. But I don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit usability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges. (Oops, think I meant to say when Jag improves the future X-type.""

Your argument was that you do not consider rear-seat room or trunk space when it comes to sport-sedans because those are two areas in which the X-TYPE excels. If it had a small boot and a cramped back seat, then you would be attacking the car for those two points! Then, to further attempt to deride the X-TYPE, you state that large boots, such as the X-TYPE has, often have space-intruding swan-neck hinges and odd opening shapes. Of course you did not have to ""name"" the X-TYPE when making such statements - you implied it and did indeed name the car with the word, ""it"". Why even mention space-intruding hinges if the X-TYPE does not have them? Also, paragraphically, your topic was about the X-TYPE, and as those areas were spoken about there, they are directly linked to the X-TYPE. However, your arguments were wrong, and to counter my catching of them being wrong, you are now stating that you were not speaking of the X-TYPE - a weak argument.

""I don't care about sales figures. What do they prove?""

You constantly say that the X-TYPE does not compete well against its competators. Sales figures and how much of the car's manufacturer's sales the car makes are a direct indication of how well the car competes. If the car did not compete well, then it would in turn have low sales figures and most probably not make up much of its manufacturer's sales. The Camry and Accord 4-cylinder are not in the entry-level sport sedan class. However, in their own class, it is generally accepted that they are very good cars. Also, the ratio of new buyers of a new addition to an established market segment is an indication of how well the car competes, and over 90% of X-TYPE buyers are new customers to Jaguar. That means that it is taking sales from competators that compete in that market segment - thus it is competing very well.

If you have not gotten the fact that there are European comparison tests of cars that are sold here in slightly different forms but with the same engines as U.S.-spec versions, then it is just a show of your unwillingness to be reasonable to any degree. I have stated that those cars are not exact doubles of their U.S. versions, but the ones outfitted with gasoline engines that are available in the U.S. and other such options are so much like their American versions that a comparison test is not going to be able to differentiate the two. If there are differences measurable by the tests, then you can take them into account. However, to invalidate the entire test is ignorant and unreasonable.

""Do you harp on such little things regarding the X-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors?""

No, I ""harp"" on such little things because YOU bring them up by making FALSE assumptions which you present as if they were facts. Again, I used those ""little"" subjects as examples to prove my points because facts are a necessity in presenting the truth. YOU are the one who decided to ""harp"" on my examples.

Also, as I have stated and continue to have to remind you, the X-TYPE does not get beaten in the performance realm against competators. EXAMPLES: the X-TYPE completely won an all-out performance test against the competing model from Mercedes-Benz, the C320 Sport. It is a competing car. Then, your so-very-important Road&Track even states: ""In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest. Accompanied by a nice-but-distance exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300's and Audi A4's 7.1, Mercedes-Benz C320's 6.8 sec. and matching the BWM 330i's time. And remember the X-TYPE, like the Quattro, loses a tick off the line, because of a no-wheel spin launch with all-wheel-drive"". According to your precious magazines, it also out brakes the Porsche 911 GT2 from 80 mph and stops just 2 feet shorter than the 911 GT2 from 60 mph. That is real performance and if you try to argue that down, I believe I could safely say that it is a sign of a delusional mind.

Perhaps you should stop simply reading my posts, but should actually begin synthesising the data as well. I'm having a hard time responding to much of the outrageously false statements you've made thus far.

You did get one thing right though. Jaguar is getting diesel engines ready for the European market as they do make up for much of a manufacturer's sales there. That was a weak point for the X-TYPE: it had no diesels to compete against the 330d etc. with the high gasoline prices in Europe. Rest assured that when the engines are available, the X-TYPE will compete even better than it already does so well. And when I'm on the track, I'll remember to mention my car's boot to the Porsche that I out-brake and to the IS 300, A4, C320 that I out accelerate and the BMW driver that I'm dead-locked with. Even Road&Track took note of that."
135,jagboyxtype,"September 26, 2002 2:41AM","Merc1-

Other marques are not claiming that they have more rigid structures than the X-TYPE has because they do not. You say that you'll go by what you feel feels more solid, however, I could just say that the X-TYPE feels more solid to me and say that the discussion is over. Either way, we cannot do that. AutoWeek had the measurements for structure rigidity in their article, and I even quoted them a little way back. They also noted that the X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader's. That means that the previous class leader no longer has the class-leading structure in rigidity because the X-TYPE, now the class leader in structural rigidity, beats it by 30%. You are just choosing not to accept a fact.

As for the X v. C article, you say that they chose to test in areas where the X-TYPE would win, but then wouldn't other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins? The same can be said about any comparison. Look at what is said in these articles, point-wise, the C-Class may win, however, in actual measurements, the X-TYPE beats it. Take for instance what Road&Track said about acceleration, which I quoted above in my message to riez.

If the measurements of the A4's rigidity came out and proved to be higher than the X-TYPE's, then I would accept that, however, at this moment, the X-TYPE is known as the most rigid car in its class.

This is not to say that the A4 has not surpassed the 3-Series in rigidity or possibly the X-TYPE, or to say that the car or any of the cars in this class are lacking in structural rigidity; it is simply to say that with the information available, all current measurements have proven the X-TYPE to be the most rigid to this day.

From these results

This is the X-TYPE section of the car crash test above:


http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002


Take note that this is the ""Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD"" marked under the ""Make, model and hand of drive"" portion of the chart at the bottom of the page. The X-TYPE 2.0 is the low-end Europe-only version of the car that lacks the extra driveshaft that the 2.5 and 3.0 litre models have that are sold globally (as well as the driveshaft that is found in the 3-Series and C-Class). Thus, its crash tests produce weaker results than the 2.5 and 3.0 versions, and 3-Series and C-Class, because 2.0 is a FWD car with no longitudal driveshaft that is found in AWD (X-TYPE) and RWD (C-Class, 3-Series) cars.


Check out this site:


http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/0210.htm


It notes that the X-TYPE underwent structural changes after December 2001 but does not say if that was a version-specific change (which I discovered it was). A letter to Consumer Reports aided research, and their reply was as follows:


""We spoke with JNA (Jaguar North America) on this question and they explained that the Jaguar X-Type was originally introduced in Europe as a 2.0 litre FWD (Front Wheel Drive) model. The only models sold in the U.S. are 2.5 and 3.0 liter AWD versions.... that achieve better frontal crash test results than the FWD European model due to a prop shaft that runs the length of the car from front to rear. The prop to the rear supplies power to the rear wheels as well as the front, which accounts for the AWD traction... The modifications made and referred to in IIHS's report on X-Types (made) after December 2001 were actually modifications made to FWD European models and are not applicable to the U.S. AWD models.""

(Thanks ""JagDude"" and Consumer Reports for this information).


Also note that the reason why the C-Class recieved a 5-star rating in the European test over the 4-star rating that all of the others in this class recieved was because it was the only car that had a flashing light that lit-up a sign reading the equivalent of ""fasten your seatbelt"" on its dash, which is to become a standard feature in Europe in the future(?). It would have recieved that same 4-star rating had it not had the light. This is straight off the site:


""Extra points awarded for the way that the C-class reminds its passengers to buckle their seat belts have now made it the second car ever to gain a five-star crash protection rating. Results for the C-class were published last year and it achieved four stars. But Euro NCAP has since changed its scoring system to encourage car makers to fit seat-belt warnings.""


All in all, I'd feel very safe in any one of the cars in this class, and I do feel safe being in one of them. Stay safe everyone."
148,linard,"September 29, 2002 5:58PM","I honestly cannot remember a car I've been in that HASN'T had a seatbelt warning light. Our 87 Mercedes 420 SEL had it and my 99 Honda Prelude has it. Maybe this is due to European influence as the Focus (originally introduced and designed in Europe) has an obnoxious system that beeps and chimes if the driver does not fasten within an allotted amount of time and other cars I've been in have ""sensed"" the weight of a passenger and have flashed the seatbelt light as well (I believe the LandCruiser does this). However, as the seatbelt usage stats are dropping in the US, maybe this is a good idea after all. I can personally attest my safety and my mother's life to seatbelts.

BTW JagBoy, the EuroNCAP X-Type was a 2002 and it stated that the FWD 2.0 was released March of that year which is supported by both CAR and Top Gear Magazines (British publications). In addition, I am relatively certain that the X-Type was introduced as an AWD model to differentiate it from the Mondeo and to keep it from alienating Jag owners who may have cringed at the thought of a FWD Jag (this is from a CAR article soon before the X-Type itself was introduced in May of 2001). However, as the base 2.5 is an already relatively expensive car and does not fare well against a C180 or 318i in terms of value, Jag decided to introduce the FWD 2.0 with a stick as standard.

From what I understand, the driveshaft does assist in distributing the crash impact rearward, however, the larger engine block of the 3.0 tends to push rearward earlier in an accident than the smaller block of the 2.0 with it's fewer driveline components (obviously as it is FWD) so the crumple zones of the 2.0 have more room to crumple. I believe this is the reason why Mercedes decided to replace the 3.2 inline 6 of the E class with the smaller block of the 3.2 V6 in 99 and the difference in crash test scores between a 97 and a 00 are pretty significant although I'm not sure if Mercedes conducted any significant changes to the structure since they lowered the hood by an inch."
149,wishnhigh1,"September 30, 2002 2:49AM","""they DOUBLE their rigidity with EVERY platform update... since it's you telling me, i believe you, but that kinda boggles the mind... one would think there's a point where you can't go beyond?""

Well...yes theoretically speaking, there is a point where you cant go beyond...but nothin on the face of this earth that has a perfect structural rigidity.

We are talking about a large structure, on the scale of 100s of centimeters, which carries payloads of about 1000 pounds, and is subject to stresses incurred by hard braking and acceleration and cornering. Not to mention the constraints that mass production places on structural rigidity.

There is still a lot of flex in even the most rigid of automobiles. Even full out race cars have problems from structural rigidity...I believe the initial Audi R8 had multiple problems with body flex...parts of the body would pinch and snap hoses and electrical lines.

So, yes, there is tons of room for improvement in all cars in the area of rigidity."
150,jagboyxtype,"October 1, 2002 4:28AM","Yes, my X-TYPE also has a seatbelt warning light in the dash. Most all cars do. In addition, it chimes at you when you do not have your seatbelt on, and it has sensors in the seats that measure how much the occupant of the seat weighs and more sensors determine how far the occupants are from the dash and steering wheel so that it can calculate how much force to use when firing airbags in the event of a collision. A small amber light in the corner of the wood veneer on the passenger's side lights up and displays whether the occupant there weighs enough for the airbag to be automatically turned on or off, and the seats automatically also turn off the airbags if a baby or childseat is detected.

The warning system in the Mercedes C-Class in that test was a different light from the ones we have in our cars here. Notice that the C-Class had scored a 4-star rating in the test just as all of the other cars in that class did, but because of the addition of another light that said ""put on your seatbelt"", the car's score was later changed to a 5 to promote more lights that say ""put on your seatbelt"" to be used in other cars. I'm not saying that the C does not deserve a high rating in crash tests, but its additional star over the other cars in its class is simply because it has an additional light that tells passengers to wear their seatbelts on top of the light on the dash that says to wear your seatbelt. It is not necessarily safer than the other cars because of that light, and so I do not believe that it should have gotten an entire extra star for a light.


You are also wrong about the 3.0 Jaguar engine ""pushing"" into the cabin in a crash before the 2.5 and 2.0 because they are the same engine blocks but the 3.0 has been drilled-out more to be larger. Also, the engines do not enter the cabins at any time in a crash because the X-TYPE is designed to ""drop"" its engine when it is in a severe frontal crash. Most modern cars do this. X-TYPE's engines are also mounted horizonatally, so they are not taking up a terrible amount of longitudal space in the engine bay, thus the chances of them penetrating the passenger cabin is slim in comparison to longitudally oriented engines. Again, however, the X-TYPE drops its engine when it has a severe frontal crash, so it never enters the passenger compartment no matter what engine size is used. The argument that a 2.0 FWD X-TYPE would be safer than an AWD larger displacement version is null and void, because the engine does not enter the cabin at any time during any impact.


You really should read the bottom chart of the EuroNCAP page for the X-TYPE:


http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002


It specifically states that the car is: ""Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD. Only the FWD X-TYPE is built with the 2.0-litre engine, which again is the same engine block as the 2.5 and 3.0, but not drilled-out as much. All other X-TYPEs are built in AWD configuration. The AWD driveshaft of the AWD X-TYPEs aid in collisions v. the FWD version that is sold alongside them in Europe against 318 and C180.


Mercedes-Benz decided to changed to a V6 from an I6 because they lowered the bonnet of the E-Class between those configurations and could not fit the I-6 under the lowered bonnet, as well as because it may have cost less to produce and it could be used in more vahicles as it had better packaging. That is also the reason for the discontinuation of the E300 diesel, as the diesel engine could not fit under the lowered bonnet that was used when the V6 was introduced (that and because the E300 did not sell well here). The E-Class should have been designed to drop its engine in a crash as well. I've not heard of a modern car being designed so that its engine penetrates the passenger compartment in a collision."
151,linard,"October 1, 2002 11:37PM","While the C-Class did gain an extra star because NCAP changed it's guidelines earlier this year on performance in crashes and safety features provided, the C class did earn it's full 5 stars as it's a very well designed car collision-wise, when I can find the article in which NCAP justified giving the C class an extra star b/c of it's overall performance, I'll paste the link. As the pre 2003 E Class also includes this seatbelt light, your logic would conclude that it too, should receive 5 stars from it's previous 4 when it doesn't.

The fact that car engines are not designed to go into the passenger compartment is obvious, what isn't as obvious is while the X-Type is designed to, as you describe, drop it's engine and driveline components, they will always ""push"" into the compartment as evidenced by the Insurance Institute's listing of the crash details in which the X-Type exhibited moderate footwell intrusion, between 8 to 12 cm. The best rated C Class, on the other hand, had intrusion measures of 2 to 3 cm. Engineers are constantly trying to limit this phenomenon. While I don't doubt the driveshaft aids in crash test scores, I wasn't trying to prove one way or another, I was speculating on a possible alternative.

And while I may be wrong on the engine block of the 2.0 being different from the 2.5 and the 3.0, I am certain that the E class' hood and front fender structures were lowered as a result of the new engine's newfound underhood space, and not due to the new engines being introduced b/c of the lowered hoodline. This is evidenced by the 99 E320 having the V6 with the prefacelifted hoodline. The discontinuation of the E300 in the U.Ss WAS caused by the low demand for that particular car AND b/c of the structural change. However, that never meant that Mercedes dropped diesels from it's complete linup, in fact, Europe still has the option of a few remarkable diesel E class engines which Mercedes could have introduced here along with the redesigned 2000 E Class."
152,merc1,"October 2, 2002 5:17AM","Speaking of Mercedes and safety. I think this wrecked S430 says it all:

154,wishnhigh1,"October 2, 2002 7:33AM","I have seen 3 Mercedes cars in accidents where the cars were totalled, two of which were rollover accidents.

One of the rollover accidents was an S430, and it had a mild cabin protrusion, but nothing serious. The cabin was in perfect shape basically. The other was I believe a 600SEL. This one was extremely important because even though this car had pillarless windows, the roof of the car did not cave in at all, even though the car came to a rest upside down. The guy was still in the car at the time, and he was hanging upside down, with no visual bruises, and a few minor cuts from broken glass.

The third accident was an E320 which was involved in a head on collision with a Camaro, who was racing another Camaro on a 2 lane road. I didnt see the drivers, but I saw the car as it was being towed away, and again, no cabin protrusion at all. The car was completely destroyed up to the point where the footwell started.

Im generally dont praise late model Mercedes', but I will always say glamorous things about them when it comes to safety. In my opinion, they are a few steps above volvo. They also have some of the strongest roof structures short of a 3"" thick roll bar."
155,sphinx99,"October 2, 2002 10:38AM","I'll say it up front, I don't think Edmunds does a consistent job on sedan reviews. I understand the whole ""they're in BMW's payroll"" thing as well as the ""but we're not"" thing. This month's letters to the editors & Edmunds' responses make good points on both sides.

Unfortunately, Edmunds does a fabulous job of putting numbers to their words that later can be dug up and compared. I'm specifically looking at the entry level luxury sedan comparos - 2001 where a TL-S edged out a 330i, then 2002 where a 330i wiped the floor with the competition. The idea (and some will agree while others disagree) is that the scores tended to deliberately put BMW above the Acura.

Is this happening? Well, I decided to look at the numbers behind the comparisons to find out. Given identical cars, whereas the two were eventually matched on performance in 2001, now there is a 20 point spread between them in 2002. What, Acura got slower or BMW got faster? Given identical front seat comfort in 2001, now for 2002 BMW front seat comfort is tops while Acura's is bottom. Did the seats actually change, or did the editors of the 2002 review have smaller rumps?

Not that only Acura gets the shaft either. In 2001 BMW got a higher ""feature content"" rating than the TL-S. In 2002, a 330i with MORE features than the 2001 model only tied the feature content rating than a TL-S with the same features. This in spite of the fact that features the 330i lacked in 2001 (dual zone climate control, indash CD changer) were simply left off the Top 10 features list in 2002, leaving BMW as a vehicle that offers every Top 10 feature as either standard or optional.

Basically, I like the prose of the articles and take away many good things from reading them. When I look at the rankings, though, they seem to be statistically invalid; if, twelve months later, your opinions on identical seats can change that much, then how can you rank these cars based on 1% differences in the final rankings?

In one of the comparos, it was stated that the margin for error was about 0.5%, and any two cars tallying numbers within .5% of each other would be considered tied. I suggest increasing that buffer to 10% in order to account for the startling differences you find between two cars after just one year.

Until then, I'm going to stop reading into the numbers and ranking, and concentrate on the prose and photographs. We spend a great deal of effort arguing here about which sedan came in #1 and which one came in #2. If you look at the numbers used to actually rank these vehicles against each other, they fluctuate so wildly from one set of editors to another (you'd think that using a set of editors would even out the fluctuation) so as to make the ranking of these vehicles practically worthless.

Front seat comfort
2001: Acura 83, BMW 83
2002: BMW 9.2, Acura 7.6

Rear seat comfort
2001: BMW 74 Acura 70
2002: Acura 9.2 BMW 5.8

Conclusion: either BMW and Acura received total redesigns in 2002 unbeknownst to all of us, or the editor butt-o-meter does not produce repeatable results."

We also had a 1987 420 SEL that was rear ended by a Pontiac Bonneville at approx 25 mph and the Pontiac's front was pretty damaged to about the front wheels.

Of course, it goes both ways. Many years ago in my first ever car, a 1988 Ford Taurus that I loved to death, I was rear-ended while sitting at a red light by an almost brand new Mercedes E-class. He had some bumper damage and the front hood was a bit bent. In contrast, my Taurus was destroyed--I was slammed into a Buick in front of me, and half the engine bay and almost all of the trunk were completely collapsed. To the dearly departed Taurus's credit, there wasn't any cabin intrusion, and I only bruised my shins, but the car was totaled while the Benz probably picked up a thousand dollars worth of body work. I'll never forget the Mercedes dude getting out of his car and bending over to keenly examine his slightly crunched bumper while I stared at my utterly destroyed car.

On a more positive note, that was the last Ford I ever owned. Whew!

In conclusion: Mercedes sedans are notable not only for their defense, but for their offense as well. If I were looking to take out Dodge Neon drivers, literally, I'd pick a S500 as my instrument of mayhem.

If you want powerful car and don't mind FWD, you might consider Acura 3.2TL, Infiniti I35, Nissan Maxima SE, or Nissan Altima 3.5SE.

Jag S-type is not normally considered ""near luxury"". Thinking its base price starts in the low $40,000s and quickly moves up with options. If you can afford this, you might consider BMW 5 Series (525i or 530i) or Lexus GS300."

04CTS vs 03LS8 (best America has to offer)
03I35/Max vs O3TL-S (best FWD on a budget)
04TL vs 04 9-5 (best FWD)
04 S60R vs X-type 3.0 (not sure there's any real AWD competition under 40k)

At post #198 you wrote, ""tryin to see if I can get a deal on a base [Jaguar] 3.0 S type and go from there."" The Jaguar S-type competes with Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, and MB E-class.

Then at post #205 you write, ""now as to the [Lexus] ES300 and [BMW] 330[i] I like but they are out of my price range."" How can these two cars, that are less expensive than a Jaguar S-type, be out of your price range?

If you can buy or lease a Jaguar S-type, you could certainly buy or lease an ES300 or 330i.

Then you also write, ""I have no idea as to how well they lease... my max payment is [$]300 and then there is another [$]250 from parents on top of that but I'd rather not have a [$]450 - 500$ lease payment but I don't know.""

The 1.8T is a nice car, but the weight tends to make it sluggish. It can be improved with aftermarket performance products (chip, exhaust, etc.), but would bring you up in price to the 3.0.

The A4 3.0 has one of the nicest interiors around. I also do mostly highway driving, and the interior combined with the performance handling makes this a pleasureable ride. In winter, the Quattro system really shines. I've been able to drive through some nasty snowstorms over the past 2 years, and I've always felt under control wherever I was going.

Audi also has a 4 year / 50,000 mile service program that covers all service at no cost to you. With that along with the 4 year / 50,000 mile warranty, all you'll spend is for gas and tires (if needed). With the 2004 models now appearing on the lots, you can make a good deal on any remaining 2003s.

The service representative told me, that my rotors are warped and I need to pay to replace the rotors. According to many sources (dealers and Infiniti customer service), most of the G35 require rotor replacement in addition to costly brake job. Infiniti knows about the problem and IS NOT paying for the rotors. Be prepared to buy yourself a new set of rotors for every brake job. And you will need this quite often, to the delight of your local dealer. Unfortunately, I was one of the early victims and did not expect that the car will be so bug ridden as it is.

BMW 3 series - If I wanted the benchmark
Lexus IS300 - CR rates this cars drivetrain almost as good as the 3-series. And as riez points out is has LSD.
Infiniti G35 - Stripper version almost the least expensive of the bunch.

Acura 3.2TL - for a sporty sedan this would be at the top of the list.

206,riez,"October 13, 2003 10:34PM","Strongly believe the segmentation should be based on what is actually paid. Not on inflated MSRPs. This is really a sign of what the market thinks is the real value of the car.

Think the heart/meant of this segment is around $27,500-32,500. With the fringes at $25,000-27,500 and $32,500-35,000. A car with an MSRP of $40,000-$44,000 that actually sells for around $35,000 really is in this segment. Lincoln (LS), Cadillac (CTS), Infiniti (M45) and some others heavily discount their cars.

This would cover everything from Acura TSX, Nissan Maxima, Jag X-type 2.5, MB C230, and 300M (at the low end) and the 330i, 525i, Jag X-type 3.0 & C320 (at the high end) with a ton of cars in the middle. Leaves cars like CTS6, LS6, and IS300 in the middle.

Jag X-type a great example. Easy to see MSRPs of the 3.0 over $40,000. But Jag needs heavy subsidies and discounts to move. And for 2004, Jag lowered the base price of the 3.0 by a couple thousand dollars and added a couple thousand dollars of ""free"" standard equipment. The market spoke what this car was worth!"

209,riez,"October 14, 2003 1:52AM","kdshapiro... I've always tried to base a purchase decision on what I can buy a particular car for and how much I think it will cost me to own. MSRP is an important consideration, more so for those marques that can charge at or near MSRP. But the reality of a specific purchase decision has to take into account the actual money that will change hands, both now and in the long haul.

Remember the old G35 vs 3 Series debate? I always mentioned BMW CCA discount for members, long-term resale value, value of free maintenance, etc. Others raised ED price. I also included CPO. When G35 first came out, there was a limited supply and it was hot to market (with dealers not moving much off MSRP, though that has certainly changed now) compared to the readily-available E46 3 Series (that came out as MY99). Just looking at MSRPs didn't do justice to the cost analysis.

Of course, since discounts may vary by region, time of year, etc., MSRP always has to be an initial starting point."
210,qbrozen,"October 14, 2003 11:53AM","not only do discounts vary by region, time of year, etc, but they vary by buyer. Comparing what YOU could get 2 different cars for can be completely different than what I could get 2 different cars for. Just because your local BMW dealer gives you $10K off car X doesn't mean I could do the same or vice versa. So comparing what cars ""sell for"" is extremely difficult. The only way I've seen to do something like this fairly is to use an online buying service where the prices are available to the public (like carsdirect or similar) or to strictly use TMV here on edmunds."

To mod the G you can do a ton with the work the guys owning 350Z have done - since the underpinnings are the same as the G the G guys do what the Z guys innovate. Cold Air intake, Pulleys, light flywheel, grounding kit, intake plenum upgrade, cams are available, headers, catbacks and true duals are almost availble. ECU upgrades to raise redline and improve mods where the ECU retard them by defaukt are available as well.

PS a guy with exhaust intake and plenum upgrade with a ECU flash got a 14.1 in an auto sedan. I think you could get to 13.9 with all the above. NA baby

Some or many of these may add up to a couple grand but its fun for me over time to do most of these things. Much more mods I think the m3 was good for and plenty more to come. There are some serious enthusiast in G forums out there too. Check em out"

with the R you'd probably be up to around 340-350 hp with modest mods like that. With the G35 its tougher to say, but maybe you could get it up to 275-285 (if a chip is available) without getting into the big money mods.

Probably the biggest advantage of the R aside from AWD is the 4C suspension. I really don't know why anyone would say it doesn't feel as planted when all reviews I've read state that you would NOT want to use the Advanced setting on the R unless you were on a track.

220,helena143,"November 12, 2003 3:47PM","Hi. I am trying to decide between the G35 and a BMW 330i, and wud appreciate any ideas on what else I shud try. (I've tried both cars plus the IS300 and the RX-8). I was almost sold on the G35 until I read about its brake and cd players problems. Plus people are not pleased with Infiniti's service.

I guess now I have no option, b/c the only comparable car to a G35 (BMW 330i w/ performance package--a must. Otherwise it's too slow.) is too much $$$. After receiving excellent service from both Honda and Saab, I have no interest in getting crap from any service dept./dealer. I mean, Saab gives you a loaner even if you are getting an oil change! And they just finished replacing the entire 200 watt Harmon Kardon sound system on my 9-5 because ONE speaker was fried (which was me playing the music too loud, not a defect). I definitely do not want to downgrade either in car quality (my 9-5 has been PERFECT) or service.

However, I just did some research on Lexis and and Infiniti is rated very high by JD Power and Associates.

For initial quality for the 2003 model year:

1. Lexus
2. Cadillac
3. Infiniti

8. BMW
11. Honda
14. Benz
29. Mazda
32. Saab

For dependability in 2003 (this rated vehicles of the 2000 model year after 3 years):

1. Lexus
2. Infiniti

13. BMW
12. Saab
26. Benz

For 1998 models after 4 years:

1. Lexus
2. Infiniti

10. BMW
16. Benz
19. Saab

Yet the bottom line seems to be that even tho Infiniti sells great cars, it has never developed the cachet of Lexus, much less BMW, etc. So it is desperate to sell cars. It is trying to rebuild its line (and Nissan) out of the slump brought on by the weak Yen and the success of Lexus.

Of course, the problem is that it seems to be caring more about GETTING customers than keeping customers.

Unless I get this car for below invoice, I won't take the chance on crappy product or service.

Am I right?"
221,bimmer97,"November 12, 2003 4:05PM","I think the s60r is nice inside , has soft leather all around, infiniti has more hard plastic. imo orange gauges look horrible in g35 while volvo has cool looking blue.
clutch is stiffer in g35, volvo has a light but spring loaded feel. the shifter of the G vibrates and takes a lot to get used to when shifting into reverse (Far right and downward motion) volvo doesn't vibrate and shifts into reverse more normally( what i'm used to)
both look good but have totally different looks G 35 has that japanesse looks whiel volvo has a more sedated euro look.
volvo steering feels looser at low parking lot speeds but tightens up when speed is increased. G-35 feels a little tight. both stick to the road and both seemed like they stop pretty well. i did not feel tubro lag and s60 had pop when accelating. s60 is awd and weighs more(don't need awd in Fla) i think the s60 is a little faster and hold a little better big 18"" wheels w P zero's.
so my delema is which one do i get.
what will hold up betterin the long term. s60r is awd which i guess is nice but really isn't needed in Fla.
one is more expensive but is damm good both in and out. one is cheaper looks better out then in.
I think the g35 sedan wont hold value as well as the s60r because they will be produced in greater quanity.
any opinions would be appreciated."

BMW get some nice comments as well but RIGHT NOW - the only thing that matters is what the math works out to be on a deal done today. By virtue of today's lease residuals it costs less to buy G coupea as opposed to a 330ci ~ all else equal.

You're not wrong to say that people have historically paid more for used Bimmers e it's true. Now the reality is people will pay the most for a G coupe of any car out there. Infiniti has had great cars for thier entire existence and now the market has bidded up one car int he lineup to reflect this. BMW manages it's used car markets better than anyone and perhaps Nissan learned something. History is nice but inadequate in most cases to accurately determine future trends. People who look backwards only in portfolio management get fired. In fact the real finds are in places where history has not been so kind."

Read the article. The bank buys the residual info from some one who analyzes the market. IF not Kiplinger then who. Even if they are reporting the facts only...you can say you've seen this change.

RE the financial discussion perhaps we should take it elsewhere. The only fundamental principal held by Chartered Financial Analysts, the highest designation for institutional money managers is having a basis for representing to a client that an invstment is suitable based on his needs. This specifically has to based on forward looking fundamentals. Reversion to the mean priciples suggests that what has done well in the past will not in the future and vice versa.

You get stuck with 66% of a car you have to be able to make money on it still. Apparently institutions belive the G is the best coupe out here based on available and recently changed residuals.

243,speedracer3,"November 13, 2003 6:52PM","BTW...leasecompare.com uses residuals from leasing companies. Most folks will lease through the manufacturer's financing arm, and those residuals tend to be much better than those from leasing companies. If NMAC wants to to subsidise 66% residuals, that's ok, I am sure the money factor is adjusted for the higher residual anyway so it balances out."
244,georgi1,"December 1, 2003 3:15AM","speedracer, you are right. In cases where companies offer higher residuals they would demand high interest (or money factors, if you'd prefer). In my experience the manufacturer's own financial company usually gives the higher residuals. However, beware that even though the monthly payments of high-res/high-mf & low-res/low-mf come out the same, if you decide to buy the vehicle at lease-end you would have to pay more for the higher residual. Personally, I've found the residual values on cars.com to better reflect what I see on used-car listings."
245,kdshapiro,"December 1, 2003 1:08PM","""you decide to buy the vehicle at lease-end you would have to pay more for the higher residual.""

Then one should be buying outright from the beginning. Leasing for 3 years and then buying is more expensive than buying outright from the beginning."

253,raher,"January 3, 2004 12:21AM","I looked at buying a BMW 330i when I was looking at the 04TL. I bought the new TL ( auto with NAV ) because the equivelant features on the BMW were $10K more. Everything was ""extra"". I am sure the 330i is a killer ride and will outperform the TL in the twisty parts of the road ( but by how much?). Then again even after paying many extra $$$ for the performance package..the 330i is still down 35hp to the TL. I used to road race motorcycles and if I only had a buck for every time I passed people in a corner only to watch them go flying past on the straight because they had more hp. How many of you actually drive your cars hard enough in a corner to get the extra benefit of the RWD on the 330i ? Many of you do however drive fast on the freeway in a relatively straight line or drive in the snow. I'll take the $10G's and the 35hp and the stereo and the NAV and on and on and on."

That is exactly the question. When you plunk down $35K for a TL when you can get a perfectly acceptable Hyundia for $12K, you start to ask yourself, is the extra $23K worth it. Is the TL over 3000% better? Of course it isn't. You just like to make yourself feel better when you think your paying less for something that you believe to be equivalent and you are really making out -because there is something that can't be used that cost money in the other item, but people can't take advantage of it.

That is the whole value equation in life. For me, either I'll get the Hyundia and pocket the $23K difference, or I'll spring for the extra $10K."

258,saugatak,"January 3, 2004 2:37AM","don't get into a debate with kd on value because to him, if you're not spending the money to drive a bmw, you might as well save as much as possible and buy a hyundai.

i don't think there's any right answer on value. bmw has prestige and road handling that is in a class by itself and if you must have those 2 things, then spending the extra money for the bmw is worth it.

if prestige does not matter to you and you're happy with a car which handles 90% as well as a BMW, then clearly it's not worth it to get the BMW.

everyone's value system and economic means are different and results in different valuations of cars. if i'm making $50 million a year, i don't care about a $10k difference in car prices between a bmw and something else (it's less than 1% of my net worth) and i'll get what i want. if i'm making $50k a year, that extra $10k represents a much greater portion of my income (20% of my net worth) and i would not part with it unless i felt the car was 20% better.

frankly, i'm sick and tired of the FWD vs. RWD debate. i have driven a ton of both FWD and RWD cars and just b/c a car is RWD doesn't mean it automatically drives better than a FWD car. Mercedes for example makes a pretty fine car, and it's RWD, but most Benzes I have ever driven have not been the greatest handling cars (Please note that I have not driven every model Benz, just going by personal exp. so no need to flame me for above statement).

For example, I had to drive my cousin's ML320 this weekend to get more food for my New Year's Party (his car was the last one in the driveway so was the only one available).

Well the seats and the sound system in the ML320 were great. The stiff steering, the sway in turns, and lack of feel on the road were awful. I hit double curves at 70 MPH in that ML320 to test it out and came out thinking, hmmm, this was a bad idea. The ML320 is a nice luxury car and has a much nicer interior than my Acura MDX, but in terms of handling, my FWD MDX kicks the RWD ML320."

I'm not advocating any one car, because I think they are both excellent cars for the individual who wants to purchase them.

I do like to play devils advocate when someone says why pay top dollar for car x, when car y offers almost the same for less and anyway you'll never use all of car x's ability. That's all well and good but you have to add the four little letters: IMHO. Who is anybody to suggest to ME, how I should spend MY money and whether a particular car is worth it to ME and whether I will or won't derive any added benefit for paying more? This train of thought can be applied against any two vehicles.

That being said, sometimes people will compare vehicles that are not really in the same target market and look at each vehicle on their own merits and then make a choice. Sometimes it doesn't matter if you get a two or seven seater and you can compare the two seater with the seven seater and each can be good in their own right. And a point in time either can satisify your requirements.

saugatak - this is not a BMW thread and comparing these two vehicles has nothing to do with BMW. I am very familiar with both cars and each of these are fine vehicles in their own right. They offer different qualities that make them very attractive to potential purchasers. There is not one worldly overridding value equation that would make anyone jump at one car or another. If there were, a manufacturer wouldn't be able to give their vehicles away."

The Accord, according to them, had better road feel, better acceleration, better brakes, better handling, etc (they labelled it the ""driver's car"" of the comparison). The Camry, on the other hand, was quieter, had better trunk access, was slightly larger (if I remember correctly), etc. The Camry won the comparison based on stuff that was mostly unimportant to me but was definitely important to others. (FWIW, I ended up with an Altima, but that was based on a financial decision above all else... for as reliable as it was, I never really liked that car).

jrock - at times you appear to be articulate, so here is a further explanation. The above quote from the original poster is an opinion, but it's also appears to be a thinly veiled opinion disguised as jealously. To reach that conclusion I draw on my own experience. I said similiar things to a friend of mine who wanted to purchase a 911. I asked him how he could justify the purchase of a 911 because the roads are crowded and you'll never be able to use all of the abilities of the car anyway and you are never going to track it. Why don't you get an M5 it's about half the price?

He said to me: ""Because I want it and I can."" Now that was me being jealous. I think we all do this stuff. Now jrock - let me add IMHO.

But we could beat this till the cows come home. CR does provide objective, factual information. I have been a reader since I was 16. And I do trust more than any other magazine their factually gathered information on autos. However, my reliability experience with cars has not jived in the past with theirs. In addition, as kominsky stated above, my priorities have not meshed with their priorities. When they pick a top rated sedan, they do so for general populace. Sometimes it's just not the car I'm looking for due to other reasons, and I pick a car that's not quite top-rated by them, but offers me what I need."
273,kennyg5,"January 3, 2004 3:12PM","IMHO, the BMW 3 series is the best handling car in the bunch, hands down. Moreover, you get the prestige of a ""premium"" nameplate if you don't mind giving up heated leather seats, sunroof, CD changer, nav and other niceties that are included in a comparably priced TL. Also, if you are single or have a family with small kids only (rear seat space and trunk size), the BMW is ideal because its relatively smaller size enhances nimbleness. If you are concerned about snow (RWD), get the new AWD Beemer, which costs a couple of grand more.

Having said all of the above, I would rather get the G35, which gives up little (if any) in performance and handling when compared with the Beemer, and use the $$ savings in filling up the gas tank that gives me miles of driving pleasure, plus the reliability of Infiniti to boot :-)"

Keep in mind that the IS300 does have a 5-speed manual. 5th is a slight overdrive. You can only get the 5-speed manual in the sedan. The SportCross version comes only with the 5-speed automatic.

You can get LSD with both transmissions, but you can only get Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with the automatic.

Can be a bit hard to find a 5-speed manual. Many Lexus dealers aren't keen on them since the overwhelming vast majority of Lexi ever sold had automatics. Check with some dealers.

I don't think I neeed to put IMHO on anything I write since it should be apparent that it is my opinion because I am writing it !
My point was more along the lines of value for performance and ""near luxury"". I think the TL is the winner on those merits because I get more for my money with the TL. Paying an extra $10K for the prestige of the BMW name is OK if what you want is prestige. I am sure the guy in the 330i I blew off at the stoplight the other day is telling himself he has more ""prestige"".
I am not sure every 330i owner is going to lose me on twisty road sections but I do know what 35hp in a straight line means. It means he better lose me in the twisty sections because he will give it back when the road straightens out.
For the $10K I didn't spend on the BMW 330i do you suppose I could make even more performance improvements or make many ""near luxury"" improvements to my TL? Oh, that's right the TL already comes with more than the BMW !

276,kdshapiro,"January 3, 2004 5:12PM","Some people don't focus on the value side of the equation. I do and I don't and it depends on what I'm getting. Sometimes I want the best.

The 3 series goes to 60 in 5.6 seconds and has a top speed of 153, does the quarter mile at about 98 and 14.(recent Car and Driver). I'm sure the guy you blew off at the light was laughing at you thinking: ""this guy has a new car and has to show it off, it's just not worth it"". Stop light races never impress me. Let's go to the track.

If you believe people buy BMW for prestige, than all people have to buy the upscale brands for prestige as well. After all why would one buy a BMW for prestige, but not an Acura, the upscale division of Honda, for prestige? If one wants to argue about the amount of ""prestige"" a car has go ahead. I sincerely believe people buy a car because of the reputation of the manufacturer.

One list thing about value. I don't need to be told a TL has more value than a 330, a Honda Accord has more value than a TL, a Mazda 6 four-banger has more value than an Accord, an Elantra has more value than a Mazda 6 four-banger. It's a given, the less you spend on a car the more value it has because it is fulfilling a basic need of getting you from point a to point b. What somebody on this forum would want to know is what is the rational for purchasing one vehicle over another. Prestige, poseurs, kinds of people who buy automobiles etc, don't answer that question, they are only self-serving reasons.

The last tome I looked at comparison stats the 330i handled about 90-95% as well as the G...Prestige notwithstanding.

As far as CR being reliable in terms of performance oriented reviews, I agree with KDShapiro in that they targtet the mass buyer and will point out some very intersting negatives occasionally. There are many IMO that will agree that they are a little more camry and minivan comparison worthy than 350Z and ZHP worthy. 50,000 acre test facililty wont get them better drivers or more enthused drivers.

All the arguments about the price/value equation have the same old value is in the eye of the beholder ending. The thing people forget with the G is that prestige is not paid for in the diplacement department and if a hypothetical buyer wants to get into the low 14 game with world class brakes and handling, he can get it for 28k. Want a comparable 330i and how much is it? 10k more at least. The whole value thing gets blown out of proportion and people need to relilze that BMW is excxlusive in that they will beat you to death with any options and everything is optional. That add'l .5 litres is a big nut and takes a very reasonable platform that can be had for a pretty good priced and makes it the same price as a 5 series.

Someone above said you could spend 20k more than a 3 and just get the 5 series - NO - you can spend less and get a 5 series in some cases. The 3 is pricey cuz people will pay it. It's called good marketing and great product/name perceptions."

Yes and I'd like to add it's also called execution and delivery. BMW products deliver. They are not an empty shill.

Chris it's always about value. It never stops being about value, but everybodys' definition is different. That is why some people will buy a $70K Rolex and some people a $10 Timex. Who am I to tell the $70K Rolex buyer it does not represent good value to them. They after all both tell time.

I can't. You can only buy what you believe fits you and your lifestyle. You will buy as much as finances allow, not less. That's why you ridicule a Hyundia. Think of how the less fortunate must feel when they get their first new Hyundia."

Second, I don't understand why BMW just does not up the horsepower in its inline 6s. Those engines have been around for a while. With all the work BMW has done on its VANOS V8s, surely they can migrate some of the technology down and free up some additional horsepower.

I've heard that Honda has the ability to get 350 HP out of its basic SOHC VTEC v6 engine. If true, that is amazing engineering and good news for Acura fans because we'll always be ahead of everyone else when it comes to the HP game. Of course, Honda had better make a RWD platform soon so we can take advantage of that power!

No matter what BMW fans say about ""Well I could beat u on the track"" or ""I don't have torque steer"" or ""if the roads were winding you'd eat my dust"", fact is raw horsepower is incredibly useful and most racing occurs not in tracks or windy roads, but on freeways or from stop light to stop light.

Every time I'm merging into the right line of a busy highway with a short exit ramp and I see that 6-ton trailer coming in my rear view mirror, I'm glad for all the horses I have and am happy for more.

I find that these discussions always start off comparing value, driving dynamics, prestige, etc. but at some point the ULTIMATE ARGUMENT gets unleashed: ""Keep telling yourself how much better your car is while you eat my dust and look at my car's disappearing [non-permissible content removed].""

It's great that TL drivers can make the ultimate argument."

Actually raher, you have been nasty. I spent a lot of time at the track when I was younger. I'm not saying BMW is the be all and end all but performance and value, are completely opposite. If you think the TL will track better than the 3 series more power to you. BTW racing non-street legal cars is a whole different ball game than taking your street legal almost unmodified car to the track.

Hey raher, my Bimmer has been to the shop..oh lets' see May 2003 last, before that August 2002. I think once a year to the shop for an oil change is sufficient. Total out of pocket costs to date: $0. I think it qualifies as reliable.

What was your first clue ? What is your point ?
I am fairly certain that the statistics on repairs etc for BMW's probably include a few more cars than just yours. I am on my third Acura and have never had a problem. Acura is rated as the number one most reliable automobile between 1999-2003 by your favorite uninformed magazine, Consumer Reports.
My point in the original post ( remember I started this discussion ) and my continuing point on this subject is that for $35K I believe the '04 Acura TL is the best value out there in a 4 door automobile. What you get for a given amount of money is one way to measure value. You get more for $35K in the TL than any of it's competitors.

According to our worthless source CR, the standard 330i will outhandle the standard G35. I am sure the standard G35 will outhandle the standard TL. Therefore the standard 330i will outhandle the standard TL.

I don't begrudge the TL anything, you can have your goodies, but I'll take the driving experience. For those who think the 330 with performance package costs $47, Blueguydotcom got his for about $39K. You might want to search the 3-series board for more information. No, it wasn't a stripper.

298,zumbalak,"January 4, 2004 10:24AM","I saw the arguments about the TL and the 330. It is all about the buyer's choice. I love my 03 M3 and I also love my 03 G35. They are IMHO exceptional cars for the price I paid. I believe m3 handling can not be easily matched with a car in the same price range, except the corvette. g35 is also an excellent car and handles almost as good as the 330, i got the g because i didn't want another bmw 3 series. the car is exceptional when it comes to performance and the looks, many people talk to me about the car in parking lots and gas stations. meanwhile an m3 is as we know m3.
i recently test drove the tl (actually borrowed it from the dealer - manager is my friend) and there was so much hype about the car, so i got it for a couple of hours (their demo) drove around the town. and i was quite impressed, it is a way better car than the old tl. but the hype in my opinion is not well worth.
the sound system works excellent if you actually have a dvd audio disc (they had one that was sent from the factory i think) and it is just excellent quality. but when you put a regular cd it is nothing ordinary.
the performance, it has excellent pick up, but the fwd downgrades the potential of this car. whatever others say, there is the torque steer, this car would have been excellent as an rwd, and i think as far as the pick up (in street start the g will beat the tl, well we know m3 performance is something else)
the interior is good quality but does not match the refinement of the bmw 3 series or the audi or the mb, but better than the g. the interior space was less than the g along with the trunk space. i guess the g is a larger car overall and that makes a lot of difference, especially for me with a family and lots of people in the car at all times. i think interior space is similar to 3 series sedan. i am 6'3"" and with my seating position there was almost no space at the back of the driver's seat (a similarity to the 3 sedan)
the handling of the car is not as refined as the 3 or the g. i realized this when i was entering a highway ramp at about 60-65 mph, and felt the need to hold the steering wheel with both hands very steady because the car almost got out of the road. it was a scary moment, and such wouldn't happen with a rwd 3 series or the g or the quattro audi. the handling is of course no issue in straight roads, but not everybody drives crazy like me in the backroads.
i would prefer an audi quattro, 3 series or the g for backroads, mountain roads, but definitely not a tl. the car just didn't make me feel comfortable enough, kind of made me scared in a couple of situations.
the looks are not so much in my style, it feels so dull and very accord like. it doesn't have a unique feeling of itself. i think they should have worked on the looks a little bit longer.
overall the tl is an excellent value for an ordinary daily driver. it offers so much for so less, good interior, good performance, good safety features, and a low msrp.
but for those who don't mind spending the extra cash i know that many will opt for other vehicles. acura tl in my opinion is the choice for first time near-luxo car buyers who do not have the ability of spending another 5k without worrying about their pockets.

i am looking forward to the new vette and most likely i will be the first in line to add the car into my garage. and then maybe trade in the g for the 05 audi a6 quattro.

meanwhile the argument of bmw is better than tl better than mb better than g better than this that can go on forever. but one need to know that everybody has a different budget, and different reason for buying a car. some people may not mind spending 40k, some people may only afford 34k some can not even afford that and some go out and buy a ferrari for 200k. instead of comparing i think it is best to drive the car and enjoy the purchase.

i honestly did not see a ferrari owner and a lamborghini owner fighting and arguing about their cars and try to prove one is better than the other.

301,kdshapiro,"January 4, 2004 4:03PM","A new 2004 Accord drove up into my driveway last night. It had all the goodies, sat/nav etc. Out the door price was a little over $28K. The TL with nav is about $35K. After tooling around in this vehicle I realized the only reason that people would go for the TL at $7K more or the TSX which is a four-banger is the ""so-called"" prestige factor of the Acura brand.

You could never derive the additional $7K in driving benefit from a TL. And it beats the TSX hands down. For the price/feature content this car beats 'em all. Of course it is FWD and if you are happy with that you will probably be getting a reliable Honda, with a powerful engine and a smooth drive train.

After thinking about it I can see why there might be some people who don't want to spring for the extra money for a 330i to get it identically optioned. It's because the perception is they are actually getting less for their money. I can now see that, as I believe when you buy a TL with nav etc your money has hit the point of diminishing returns against a similiarly equipped Accord. You are actually paying more money to get less car.

While I really wanted an X3 due to the NE climate, I might have to reverse myself and say the Honda with nav and such offers the best bang for the buck (even though it has torque steer and fwd) and save myself $12 grand, which I can use towards my kids college education or home improvements."

304,riez,"January 4, 2004 6:42PM","pg48477... You prove my point. If luxury is the primary criteria, then why are people obsessing about performance numbers? And if price/value is the primary criteria, then there are a lot ""better"" less expensive cars out there.

And that leaves us the dilemma of this board: What does it mean to be a ""near luxury performance sedan""? Are luxury and performance equal? Or is performance more important than luxury? Or vice versa?

I firmly believe in performance taking precedence, but not at the expense of luxury. And other factors like reliability, warranty, customer service, operating costs, etc. cannot be left out of the equation.

308,saugatak,"January 4, 2004 7:18PM","Think that's a topic for another board, but I don't think anyone can argue that v6 Camry or v6 Accord (will refer to them as CamCord from now on) give you best bang for buck. Yes, you can get a lower brand car but the CamCord is renowned for its reliability and low gas mileage and due to its reliability has a low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

With respect to the price differential between a nav-Accord and a nav-TL, I agree the nav-Accord wins in the value equation, but from what I've read (somebody with more exp. with both systems please help me out) the Acura's nav system is a lot better. I have not bought any nav systems in my cars to this point (I find a $20 map/atlas that I can carry from car to car is a pretty unbeatable value) so I don't know this for sure, but my understanding is that the nav system on the TL allows you to say ""Phone Home"" and then the car will dial the number for you, whereas this is not possible on the nav-equipped Accord.

Now this may seem silly to you but I kind of dig this feature a lot for 3 reasons:

1) I never use a cell phone when driving (unless I'm stuck in traffic and need to tell someone I'll be late) because it's dangerous so to be able to make voice-activated calls is incredibly useful. Time is money and if I can conduct some business while on the phone and save some time, the Nav system on the TL could pay for itself. Also, if you must talk on the phone, this is a much safer way to do it and could save your life, which is definitely worth something.

2) One of my favorite shows as a kid was Knight Rider (in spite of David Hasselhoff) because the talking corvette with the roving Cylon eye was just so cool. There is a fun factor in talking to your car and getting a response back that is hard to quantify.

3) If I buy the TL, it'll be the 6MT so with a stick in right hand and wheel in left hand, voice-activated calling is really more than a luxury, it's almost a necessity.

The point is although objectively the nav-Accord beats the nav-TL, I think there are some good reasons to spring the extra $ for the superior Acura nav./voice system.

With respect to the current generation v6 Accords, I found that Honda took all the driving fun out of the current gen. Accord. To me, they have the driving feel of a Camry and frankly, the Camry is a better Camry than the Accord is. When you compare prices on the non-nav Accord v6 and non-nav TL, I think the price difference is only $3,700 (based on my market research that I could get the Accord for $600 over invoice and the TL for $2k under MSRP based on what's been posted on the prices paid boards).

I think the extra $3,700 is money well spent to upgrade from non-nav Accord to non-nav TL. Also, I really want a 6MT and unfortunately the Accord sedan does not come in 6MT and v6. I'd have to get the Accord 6MT v6 Coupe.

And my wife's response when I suggested that we save some cash on my car by me getting the Accord 6MT Coupe was: ""I always sit in the front and you are responsible for putting son in the back seat and pulling him out of the back seat.""

Well I like to save money like the next guy, but destroying my back is not the way I'm gonna do it so it's the TL for me."
309,saugatak,"January 4, 2004 7:31PM","I don't normally defend kdshapiro, but I really think that his basic point that ""value is in the eyes of the beholder"" is correct.

It's kind of hard to compare the TL to any BMW b/c pricewise it's closer to the 3-series but sizewise it's comparable to the 5-series.

If you are someone who places a high premium on being able to hit 270 degree exit ramps at 65 and really enjoys driving your car beyond 8/10ths on twisty roads, there really is just one sedan out there for you and that's BMW. Also as someone who drove a 3-series in his 20s, I have to say that I had a much, much easier time picking up hot girls with that car than any other car I've had before or since.

I think if you exclude the 2 factors I mentioned above, the TL whomps the BMW 3-series, but getting hot girls with minimal efforts is, as they say in the MasterCard commercial, PRICELESS.

315,riez,"January 4, 2004 8:51PM","We always end up apples to oranges because we can't agree on even the most basic of things. For example, what is the relevant price spread? Is it under $40K? Over $25K but less than $45K? For me, I think the ""meat"" of this market segment is in the $27,500-$32,500 range but this segment includes outliers costing at least $25K but no more than $35K. But notice how subjective everything is?

Thus, for me, the 330i comparison should be with a stripped one, not a loaded one. The loaded ones and the 330i with Perf. Pkg push $40K. To me, $40K is squarely in the realm of luxury performance sedan. There ain't no ""near"" at $40K. That is why I went with a loaded IS300 manual for approx. $32,500 MSRP when a similar 330i was nearly $40K. For $32,500 MSRP I could get a decently equipped (but just) 325i but not a 330i. (And I don't want to bring in ED issue.)

Wish we had three boards. One for FWD, one for AWD, and one for RWD. For me, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" FWDer. That is an oxymoron. And I wouldn't want the weight penalty that AWD brings.

As the saying goes on American Idol - ""I beg to diffa"". Your statement is incorrect to the extent it is not the size or weight of a 3 series. Yes you can make a go-cart perform better than a three series, but make the Mini-cooper 3300 lbs, give it four ""real"" seats and it wouldn't outhandle a go-cart. With 0 to 60 acceleration of 8 seconds, I'm not sure how it outperforms the 330i. But in it's weight class, it just does fine. The SRT4 also outperformns the 330i, but add an additional 400lbs or so and it wouldn't accelerate it's way out of a paper-bag. Add 500lbs and 2 more seats to an S2000 to make it's weight equivalent to a 3 series and it wouldn't perform either. Yes it's very easy to make a car that out accelerates any other car, just cut down on seats, and mitigate with weight and you've got a winner. But we are not talking about these types of cars.

And the performance and fun-to-drive factor of even a Ferrari automatic pails in comparison to the same experience with a manual.

And keep in mind that SMG-type systems (used by Ferrari, Maserati, BMW, Aston Martin, etc.) are NOT automatics. They are manual transmissions with software and systems to allow an automatic mode but still don't have a torque converter.

And, yes, cars as expensive as the new MB McLaren are still not true performance cars. What is up with a hyper expensive ""supercar"" with a 5-speed MB automatic transmission? Even AutoWeek ran a poll on this issue.

shenkar... I stand by my subjective opinion. A Ferrari with an automatic transmission is a travesty, one reflected in the future resale market. It is less than what a Ferrari could and should be.

kahunah... And your 270 HP TL FWDer will also out torque steer my car. Too much weight over front wheels which are also drive wheels. FWDers can never escape the laws of physics.

I'll agree that on the racetrack or on the twisty-bits, the manual equipped car will generally rule...all else being equal.

335,fedlawman,"January 5, 2004 7:27PM","Your assertion that a car must be RWD to be a ""true"" sports car is preposterous.

Compare the IS300 to the Mazda 6s. Both cars are within a hair of each other in HP, TQ, 0-60 and 1/4 mile acceleration, skidpad grip, slalom speed, and braking distances.

Even the weight distribution is close (54/46 vs. 59/41).

Yes, dynamically FWD and RWD perform differently. From a standing start, the IS300 has an advantage over the Mazda 6 because it has better traction to the drive wheels. On a racetrack however, that advantage is gone, as it simply requires a different driving technique (line) to make a FWD go fast vs. a RWD.

Basically, going around a road course quickly involves three elements - power-to-weight ratio, braking performance, and traction. In corners, traction is key because the more you have, the more power you can put down on the pavement. The factor that most affects traction is weight transfer, which is why smoothness is so important for fast lap times.

Compared to a FWD car, in a RWD car, turn-in happens sooner because during braking (entry), weight shifts away from the drive wheels, and the resulting loss of traction can cause oversteer. Since turn-in is earlier, the apex also comes sooner, causing the line to straighten and allow the driver to begin accelerating. This technique obviously won't work well in a FWD car because the ""wrong wheels"" need the traction to exit the corner. Therefore, weight transfer through a corner must be managed differently for a FWD car.

If you're piloting a FWD car into a corner, you adjust your line by braking and turning-in later. This adjusts the line by moving the apex out farther. With a later apex, the FWD'er straightens the line through the turn and can accelerate harder, sooner.

It may not seem as natural to you, but it is no less effective at producing fast lap times.

As far as torque steer is concerned - no it's not fun, but modern high performance FWD cars (like the Mazda 6 or Acura TL) have it managed very well, so if it's present at all, it's more of a distraction than a performance handcap.

Of course, all of this talk is moot on the street. At 8/10ths, it rarely comes into play.

For the most fun and biggest performance gains, attend a driving school and put good rubber on your wheels."

I just drove the new TL my dinner buddy purchased last week and watched the review on the TL on Speedchannel...cant remember the show as I was taking one of my 14 naps over the last two weeks and so was groggy at the time...but the reviewer hammered the thing for having too much power for a Front Driver.

 All the nice sentiment over FWD is great but the platform will have a limit that this car seems to exceed. The comment was the accord has about the right of power...anyone else see this so as to help me remember the show?

The very thing Rear Drivers enjoy is the differnt stlye of driving that reat powered cars afford us.....that little correction to puposefully oversteer to put the car in line as the weight transfers to the drive wheels is the majic that people wont give up. As a 10 year front driver...they are fun in turns - really...but not as fun and not as easy to apex as RWD.

The chatter from torque steer is one of the most unsettling things you can deal with - not for fear of losing control as FWD are easier to keep in contol...just feels cruddy when your driving and it feels like an earthquake is shaking the wheel...and combined with LSD and traction...its a little bit worse than my integra was."

That said, while I don't believe FWD takes away from the fun to be had driving the TL, I do suspect that its 3700# curb weight makes it more of a Grand Tourer than a canyon carver.

339,chrisboth,"January 6, 2004 12:23AM","ACura rocks in many ways - the TL is a sweet ride but it is not a sports sedan at 85-95% of the envelope - while it may perform in curves nearly as well - hell even as well - better? possibly with ASPEC, it won't feel as competently done.

 That late turn in the FWD offers is kinda neat and I enjoyed it in the acura's I've owned and driven but the rumbling torque steer over bumps or uneven pavement is a very unimpressive offering for you and your passengers in a heavy car even.

The tsx may be the best value for that market segment ever. It's very much like the TL in terms of appearance and stance...TSX owners must love it! And not vice versa"
340,riez,"January 6, 2004 12:45AM","fedlawman... Please review the earlier recent posts. As I said, I am NOT talking smooth test track performance. Heck, using that criteria a FWDer with a live rear axle can be quite the performer. I'm talking on the real roads I drive every day. On the twisties. On the curves. On the bumps. (You really appreciate IRS when you are taking a nice sweeper fast and you hit a bump. When you lack IRS the entire rear bounces up in the air and you say a silent prayer. Not unlike torque steer!)

Today I had fun ""playing"" with my business FWD Sonata (V6, 5-speed manual with defeatable traction control) in the snow and ice. She tugs and pulls like crazy every time she loses traction. All that weight over the front wheels and those drive wheels trying to steer at the same time they fight for traction. You fight to steer her. Just take a corner as you lose some front wheel traction. Pulls left then right. Laws of physics. That is true for every FWDer I've ever driven hard. (And, yeah, I had fun driving '01 TL Type S but she torque steered. Same for the I35 Sport I drove.) Only way to go is to ensure the drive wheels are not the steering wheels!

Don't forget that 5% of 3,000 pounds is 150 pounds. FWDer is like having your pre-teen sitting on your hood all the time."
341,saugatak,"January 6, 2004 12:47AM","FWD vs RWD has been debated to death. My personal take is that the difference is overrated.

MB makes RWD vehicles but how well do they handle? Every MB I've ever driven has been a nice car but handling wasn not really its strongest characteristic.

Lexus makes both FWD and RWD cars, but aside from Riez's favorite IS300 (LOL, he has 2 of 'em), I would really have to focus very hard to tell the difference in the drivetrain. A soft plushy ride completely divorced from any feel for the road sucks whether the drivetrain is a FWD or RWD.

If you really want to make a performance car, you not only have to have the RWD but you need to do all the other things it takes to get the weight balance as close to 50-50. Not sure what the exact weight balance on the IS300 is Riez, but it doesn't sound anywhere close to 50-50, so on that basis Infiniti G35 and BMW are going to be a lot better than IS300.

Also, I think if you are used to a RWD and then go to a FWD, the difference is really noticeable so you tend to overemphasize it. The opposite is also true.

For example, I'm now used to my MDX and when I had to drive an ML320, it took me a while to get used to the turns. Once I got used to it in 5 mins. it was fine.

I find that as long as I have some feel for the road, I can get used to just about any car and drive with my normal skill level, and after a while don't notice it unless I try to go above 7/10ths.

Living in the NE, I prefer FWD b/c I can slap on all seasons and not worry about snow tires. Yes, you can get a RWD/AWD sedan, but those are a lot heavier, so their performance is compromised and they eat up a lot more gas.

When I move to CA, where bad weather isn't as much of a problem, I'd give a lot more consideration to RWD, but I'm not going to let the drivetrain alone influence my decision as to which car I want."

I think a more valid comparison is the ES330 vs GS300. Both offer soft, plush rides with little road feel. ES330 has too little power to have any torque steer. Does the drivetrain really make a difference? I mean, how much do I care that a bad handling RWD car might handle slightly better than a bad handling FWD car?

It's very interesting to me that the accord popped up a few times in this thread about near luxury cars.

I must say that the 240hp accord seemed more powerful than the BMW, with only marginally worse handling. granted I was not on a race track, but this is everyday driving.

I also must say that this accord had every possible option and is $4,000 cheaper than the BMW that has almost no options (not even power seats!) I was amazed that you could actually talk to the navigation system.

Finally, I was amazed at how plush the honda was and how spartan the BMW was. the BMW was almost embarassingly uncomfortable on the inside.

All this being said, can anyone really justify goping with the BMW here? Also, can anyone justify spending $4k more for the Acura TL.

Maybe go for the BMW because of 1) all wheel drive and 2) prestige of driving a BMW?

With that said do you really know your cars limits, I bet you don't, because if you do you must of crash it a few times (or be really close to it) to understand were exactly the limit is. In order to compare RWD and FWD you really have to spend alot of time driving each one and really push it to the limit, and that would only be possible only on the race trace or on the empty road at night. I don't think any of you two had this kind of experience and for this meter so as anybody else on this side including myself. So if you think that RWD is better than FWD that is your opinion, not a fact, and it varies from car to car.

But to answer the question, I push the car pretty darn hard. I don't drive to smash 'er up or to race it, but the predictable response, smooth drivetrain and communicative steering let's me do almost anything. Now could a professional push it harder, absolutely.

Honda Accord V6 to a BMW 325 for $28,000. To me it's no contest, the Honda is very nice at that price. I never go for loaded cars, but there is a certain level of options that I want. A $28,000 BMW does not have it. Having just driven a loaded Honda Accord, I can say it drives very nicely. Could I see myself driving it? Absolutely? Does it handle anywhere close to my 330i. Not a chance. But if the sport in sports sedan doesn't matter, it's a compelling choice.

pp - I agree. If you're idea of handling is to plow threw snow with all-seasons a FWD will outdo a RWD. But I can feel the difference between a great FWD and a great RWD. It is no contest. Does it make a difference going to work on traffic clogged streets. No. But that is not what this conversation is about, or else we would all be driving Hyundais (sorry shenkar that's the last of it). A great RWD will be able to outperform in the aggregate a great FWD, because of the balance and power delivery. As I said it doesn't make a difference in traffic cloggeds streets, but that is not what this conversation is about. What drive-train one chooses is a personal preference. They each have their advantages and limitations.

But let's not confuse the ability of the car with the ability of the driver or amount of traffic on the road."

There is no voodoo or gospel here and no marketing hype. Marketing hype is what got FWD to suceed.

Change PA to NY or NJ and here's my take. The handling will be compromised at best without snow tires. This applies to any RWD vehicle. Preferably 4 good snows will make a big difference."
367,qbrozen,"January 6, 2004 3:57PM","chrisboth - FWD is a thing of the past...
since it is cheaper for manufacturers to use FWD and serves to make smaller and lighter cars (which translates to better gas mileage), then, no, you won't see that happen. But, if I were to entertain your idea for a moment and throw away all benefits to a manufacturer, I'd have to say BOTH RWD and FWD will be in the past and everything will be AWD.

AWD does add weight, lower fuel efficiency and compromise handling. The trade-off is the ability to handle torque with the loss of balance posed by the additional hardware. But to some the trade-off is worth it."

Given 2 identical cars in every other way accept drivetrain configuration, the extra weight of AWD will most likely lose, but, again, on a dry course.

When looking at test results, you have to look at what track, track conditions, drivers, tires, methodology, etc.

Keep in mind that F1, NASCAR, etc. all have arbitrary rules. NASCAR uses live axles and carburetors (I can't hardly spell this archaic word). Much more powerful F1 cars have various restrictions on engine size, etc. F1 cars in early 1980s put out 1,200 HP. Today they are more like 900 or so HP.

380,saugatak,"January 7, 2004 12:47AM","I agree that a well built well designed performance car with RWD is the best handling sedan out there ON NON-SNOWY ROADS.

In 2002 in the Northeast when there were a lot of snowstorms, RWD cars without snowtires got stuck on the road. If my ride were a BMW 330 (not an all wheel drive), I'd have to buy at least 2 snow tires for the rear wheels and hang on to them. Then I'd have to go to the mechanic to get them installed before the snowstorm hits.

Oh no, everyone else is on line doing the same thing and the mechanic can't get to me, too bad. Now I'm stuck on snow roads with regular tires in a RWD car. Oh damn, now I just got stuck and have to walk home in 2 foot snow while getting snowsprayed by all the FWD cars going through no problem. Or better yet, I just spun out but before I crashed I was thinking ""Well this is a small price to pay for having a RWD performance car.""

In NY, I drive a FWD car out of choice b/c I have gotten stuck in snow in RWD cars, but I have never gotten stuck in a FWD car. And yes, I did have an AWD Audi but the extra weight on the car made the car really slow and a gas hog.

And what happens if I trade in the car and it uses different size tires? Now I have to get new snow tires and try to sell the old ones. Good luck getting value for those old snow tires.

In sum, RWD in a good performance car gives best performance but that don't mean much in snow.

AWD gives best snow performance but on dry roads it's slower, the heavier weight of the car affects its turning ability and when you have to do a lot of turning the software on the AWD system gets confused so the car acts schizophrenic.

FWD doesn't give as good a performance in snow as AWD, but it's usually good enough and its performance on dry roads is second to RWD but better than AWD, and it usually has the best gas mileage.

I think that manufacturers will continue to make FWD, RWD and AWD cars to suit different tastes and climates. Since the CamCord are the best selling cars and they're FWD (plus they show no signs of giving up the sales crown), I disagree with your contention that FWD cars are a thing of the past."

...as they put it, most of their favorite V6 family sedans like the Accord, Camry, and Passat ""scored higher in our tests than most of the vehicles in this category, and they cost about $3,000 to $9,000 less.""

If you want to see how the 330i and IS300 stack up, you have to pull out the May 2001 issue of CR.

Speaking of tires...

330i was non-Sport Pkg and rode on 205/50R17 93V (mediocre) Continental ContiTouringContact tires.

TL rode on Bridgestone Turanza EL42 P235/45R17 93W tires.

IS300 rode on Goodyear Eagle GS-D 215/45ZR17 87W tires.

For those who love numbers, with each being tested with an automatic transmission...

60-0 mph dry braking: IS300 128 ft, TL 130 ft, and 330i 131 ft

Avoidance maneuver: IS300 57 mph, 330i 55.5 mph, and TL 52.5 mph

0-60 mph: 330i 6.6 secs, TL 6.7 secs, and IS300 7.4 secs

45-65 mph: TL 4.2 secs, IS300 4.4 secs, and 330i 5.3 secs

1/4 mile: 330i 15.1 secs, TL 15.2 secs, and IS300 15.7 secs

CR clearly points out that the TL cannot handle like the 330i or IS300.

Overall fuel economy: TL 23 mpg, 330i 22 mpg, and IS300 21 mpg

Predicted reliability: IS300 best rating with TL and 330i getting next best rating (in original test). In today's data, IS300 retains best rating and 330i has fallen to only average reliability.

Interesting that of the 15 cars in their ""upscale sedan category"", the FWDers finished 1st, 4th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 14th, and 15th. The RWDers finished 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 12th. The AWDers finished 7th and 13th. Say the RWDers win this one."
382,fedlawman,"January 7, 2004 1:50AM","The TL's biggest handicap vs. the IS300 and 330i isn't its drivetrain, it's curb weight."
383,riez,"January 7, 2004 1:56AM","FWD is inherently front heavy. And it asks the drive wheels to steer. FWD cannot overcome the laws of physics. Which is one reason there is no FWD supercar.

A FWDer and RWDer of the same total weight will NOT have that weight evenly distributed. That weight distribution penalty causes an inherent disadvantage.

And since the best tires can go on any vehicle, the FWDer cannot overcome its limitations by using better rubber."

Goodyear Eagle GS-D 215/45ZR17 87W tires: handling rating - 8.80, dry traction - 9.20, wet traction - 9.10
ContiTouringContact 205/50R17 93V tires: handling rating - 8.30, dry traction - 8.70, wet traction - 7.7

The number are based on 10 point system and taken from tire rack.

As you can see TL has the worse tires by far. This is why TL scored marginally lover in handling and accelerations tests, plus as somebody mentioned TL is also heavier.

With that said , if you put the same tires on all three vehicles you will get almost identical numbers in handling."

Do you happen to know the DOT grades (temperature, wear, and traction) for each of these tires?

The ContiTouringContacts are NOT a performance tire. Continental ContiSportContacts and ContiSportContact 2s are Continentals highest performing tires. My wife's '00 323ia had the Tourings; I put a set of SportContact 2s on my '98 540i6. World of difference.

What is the difference? Value should, by definition, take all aspects of the purchase into account, including capabilities. Weighing the capabilities and content against the cost equates the value.

Actually, the $7K to get from the Accord to the TL doesn't get you $7K worth of benefit toward the Bimmer.

My point is that in the real world RWD has its limitations. In cases of snow, FWD has the advantage. As for AWD SUVs, that's the biggest joke. You would not believe how many SUVs get towed out of snow banks and ditches in Toronto after a snow storm -- way too many. I've been driving FWDs in snow for 14 years and never, ever got stuck.

If I can't do that, I'd rather drive the Bimmer. Anyway since we're talking about unused capabilities, why don't you drive a Honda Accord and save yourself $7K, if you are sitting in traffic. You have unused capabilities, especially with the inbound Toronto traffic in the morning.$4K for a good aftermarket stereo along with a Honda could still save you money over a TL."

They owners are a joke. FWD is not as capable as AWD there can't be argument here can there be...? Perhaps the AWD owners should learn how to drive and recognize that AWD doesn't make for better stopping.

And if the only advantage that can be stated for buying the BMW over the TL is that extra .5 G of roadholding ability, that's just not going to pursuade me to fork over all that extra money. And, according to C&D, even the Accord coupe you are fond of mentioning is faster in the quarter mile than the 330 with performance pack.

But there is so much more to consider aside from numbers. The TL is quieter, quicker, better handling, more solid, better shifter, better clutch, better interior materials, etc. over the Accord. I can't say all that regarding the BMW."

it's your money and it's your choice how to spend it.

as someone currently living in NYC and paying close to $400 a month in garage fees, i'd be paying nearly $5k a year in parking fees alone to be able to do what you're doing.

i frankly don't enjoy the advantages of RWD so much that i'll pay the extra in parking fees so i choose to go with FWD.

your categorical statement ""There is little else to know once these facts are revealed to RWD fans. Its on deaf ears."" is just plain wrong. people have needs, budgets, space limitations plus a desire to simplify one's life (something to be said for not having to worry about maintenance, insurance, registration, etc. for another car when you can only drive one at a time).

seems like a big waste to have 2 cars for yourself when you can get by with one, but i realize my personal minimalist philosophy of trying not to clutter your life with too many things is not for everyone.

I think we all agree that performance is marginally better, or I should say handling, so I 'll give this to 330(just to make you happy)

Styling is in the eyes of the beholder , you like 330 better others dont, I like both equally(330 better exterior, TL better interior), so lit say it's a tie.

Value goes hands down to TL, I think most us will agree, I think you can't include handling, because you already got a point for performance.

I would also give TL a point for features, but I'm not gona because it's part of the value.

Price I think all agree TL gets the point.

Cost to lease will go to TL. Lease for a none nav TL about $420-$450 including tax and maybe another $1,500 for all fees, total - $17,700 plus oil change $400= $18,100.
330 (performance pakg) lease is close to $550-$600 including tax plus fees $1,500 = $23,100.

In that test it came out fourth behind the Lincoln LS6, Cadillac CTS, and Nissan Maxima 3.5 SE, but ahead of the Saab 9-3 Vector.

They tested a G35 automatic. Test data:

Dry braking, 60-0 mph: 133 ft
Avoidance maneuver: 54.0 mph
0-60 mph: 6.8 secs
1/4 mile: 15.4 secs
45-65 mph: 4.3 secs

Also, you have to take into account CR's methodology. Compare that to methodology of car magazines. Auto press usually uses whatever most aggressive method at launch.

448,kdshapiro,"January 8, 2004 2:14PM","The Ultimate Argument does not hold water. Performance figures do not indicate a 330i will be seeing the taillights of any car in this category.

Since I have no plans on racing you on the street and potentially hurting myself or other drivers, I will have to leave it to people who measure such things.

Even with CRs testing methodolody, G35 came in behind 330i. It's not about the 330i being faster, it's about the 330i being the more expensive, holding it's own against cars having bigger engines, with a 35 hp/torque advantage. And while the 330i may lose the quarter mile to a G35, it loses by .1 second to a car with a .5 liter bigger engine.

riez - I believe is correct, that car mags use a do-or-die method to get the absolute fastest time. You wouldn't necessarily want to do that to your car. CR probably uses a more conservative approach, where drivetrain parts do not get strewn all over the tarmac.

Not knocking either car, you can't dismiss the performance/handling aspect of the 3-series, while extolling the value aspect of either car.

As for fuel economy, despite technological advancement, performance and economy are fundamentally opposite objectives. And gas is cheap compared to the total cost of this class of cars.

As an owner of none of these, but a long time shopper, my opinion on the best for each function.

Exterior Design: All good, all different
Interior Design: A4, TL, C-Class
Size/Space: G35 and TL
Acceleration: BMW, G35, TL
Braking: all very similar
Handling: BMW, G35, IS300
Cost: Similar except the 330i, C-Class cost more
Reliability: Japanese better than European

For me personally, Acceleration, Handling, Size, and Cost are more important than the interior, so if I were shopping for a sedan it would lead me to the G35.

476,riez,"January 9, 2004 12:31AM","chrisboth & kahunah... What percentage of long-term ownership costs do you think are related to fuel? Not much. Depreciation is the biggest hit. Don't forget about insurance. TTL. Annual registration. Maintenance, including tires.

I paid about $30,000 for the car. I'm getting about 25-26 mpg. If I drive 100,000 miles over 6 years that will take about 3,922 gallons of fuel (at 25.5 avg.mpg). In my town right now premium (Amoco/BP Ultimate, the only fuel I use) costs about $1.63 per gallon. That would be a mere $6,393 in total fuel costs. My car insurance over the same time would be about $7,200. The intitial tax on the car was around $1,500. In the first five years of ownership, it will cost me about $1,950 just to register the car ($325 per year). Four sets of tires will cost me at least $1,600 (at just $100 per tire). And what will depreciation be over this 100k/6 years? Probably about $20-24,000.

So that $6,393 in fuel isn't a big consideration. Say I got 30 mpg. That would be 3,333 gallons for $5,433. Or a mere $960. $160 per year. Or just $.0096 per mile driven. Is this a big deal? Not even a penny a mile.

[Hope I did my maths right.]

485,cybersol,"January 9, 2004 10:34AM","Well, first of all, horsepower has little to do with acceleration, its all about top speed. Acceleration is about torque, and not just peak torque, but the whole area under the torque curve. The TL achieves 238 lb.ft. @ 5000 rpm while the BMW achieves 214 lb.ft. @ 3500 rpm. So there is only 24 lb. ft. of difference in the peak torque, but the bmw acheives it much earlier. An earlier torque peak generally means a much broader and flatter torque curve in general (less peaky). It also generally means less peak hp, which explains the large hp difference.

And second of all, the engine is not alone, power is tramsitted to the ground via the gearing of the transmission and the final drive axle. Gear spacing affects acceleration by allowing the engine to stay longer between its peak torque and peak hp. The first gear ratio also needs to be selected so as to deliver maximum power without overpowering the wheels and tires that will deliver the force to the ground.

All that being said, I listed the BMW, G35, and TL because they are approximately equal in all the acceleration testing I have seen. There seems to be just as large a variation in the times of different G35s, for instance, as there is a variation between the three different models."
486,riez,"January 9, 2004 1:02PM","The RX is based on the Camry.

The IS300's ""lowish"" highway fuel economy estimate is due to its gearing. It does not use a very deep overdrive 5th gear. I'd prefer a deeper overdrive, but you hardly have to shift out of 5th in order to pass. The IS300 is performance car, not an economy car. Designed for drivers who even want performance in 5th gear?

Just compare the gearing in the Camry and RX versus the IS300 (taking into account both final drive ratio and the individual ratio of each gear).

If you want to complain, check out the mileage differences between the 325i and 330i. The less powerful 325i isn't very fuel efficient. And part of that problem is tied to its gearing (as well as a smallish engine for the car's weight)."

Isn't that the point. It doesn't matter for example, why people don't understand why BMW sells boat loads of their 3-series, just that they do. However, in the pursuit of automotive excellence the press provides a function in determining in a more unbiased fashion, than you or I debating the merits of a particular vehicle or aspect of a vehicle.

The reason I posted that information, is to show in contrary to some other opinions that the 3-series is a has-been, the automotive press still regards it as a benchmark in the world of entry level luxury sport sedans. This is not in one magazines opinions, but others as well. Looking at automotive opinions is just one way of level setting the conversation.

Now you could go say you don't believe that vehicle is for you or that it doesn't have any value to you, or other vehicles do some aspects in the world of sports sedans better.

516,riez,"January 25, 2004 6:47PM","Pretty much anytime the automotive press (rightly) touts the 3 Series, they normally are talking about either the M3 (a most awesome car!) or non-M cars with (1) manual transmission and (2) Sport Package.

A 325i automatic without Sport Pkg is a rather expensive and somewhat mundane car. There is really nothing unique about it other than the marque badging. But it lacks those critical features (1) and (2) that create the ""difference between what is simply good and what is genuinely excellent.""

If you LOVE to drive there is only one way to get a 3 Series: Sport Package and manual transmission. All the others are pretenders as serious all around sport sedans.

And IF BMW was so serious about the love of driving and creating the true existential difference between good and excellent, where is LSD??? That speaks volumes. Only M3 and M5 have LSD. Does BMW think the other buyers aren't smart enough to figure it out? Or do they know something about their buyers that we don't?

But guess what percentage of 3 Series, esp. sedans, are sold with automatics? Bet it is at least 60 percent. And what percentage of 3 Series sedans have Sport Package? Doubt it is over 25 percent.

The FM platform has been recently compared to the GT-3 porsche...and often compared to the 5 series...who really is worried if the everyman 3 driving public gives credence to the car that actually performs better than the 3 the 5 the boxster the audi a4 and a6 the mercedes 320 in any model and........."

The BMW is still more than being merely competitive, even with less power. Are you saying the 3 is no longer the benchmark and that MB, Audi, Jaguar and others are studying the G35 now?

Despite my fascination with German cars, the G35 Coupe is a strong contender for my next car, but the interior is downright cheap for this class of car. Whether or not it's trying to be different is open for debate, but that still doesn't mean it has to be cheap feeling/looking.

The tourque peak is at around 4 - did you actually drive it. The end of the fun is around 6k if you look at the curve and actually drive one it;s quite apparent. Lets not forget the TL v G 1/4 mile and 0-100 numbers....

At 4 grand with WOT the G IS as fast as an M3 until 6K This does not make it a better car than an M3. The bang for buck is exactly where you say it isn't in the G. When you go for another drive notice it has almost a turbo lag until about 3200 rmp - and then thrust city. Your statement is quite absurd IMO. At 4k the thing is worth BMW money and I may have paid it.

Take a look at torque numbers per litre for each. While you are waiting to come alive I've been thrusting down the pike and showing you my led's!

""Are you saying the 3 is no longer the benchmark and that MB, Audi, Jaguar and others are studying the G35 now?

I doubt the germans will ever emulate the japanese - too bad for many reasons too but I am saying the G35 is teh benchmark now. Look at the New GS lexus shows at the detriot show I believe for 2006. Looks like the G has had an impact for the next generation in design. Did you see the rear quarter - they may get sued.

Look at the numbers look at the design and the reliablity. Hell if you dont like the interior as much as i love my willow leather and titanium then wait 12 months and see what happens. The benchmark should not lose to a first timer in performance, be smaller and cost more while in the same class and be considered anything but playing catch up ala the 3.8i v8 3 series coming soon (with a G competitive price too).

Is there that much of a difference in G over three - NO NO NO. It's simply my argument that that 3 being a benchmark is yesterdays hype still rolling with powerful marketing intertia. The 3 is great no G owner want to take that away from anyone...it's just not the only one anymore and not the best by the performance numbers. If there is something else besides great numbers and looks to pay for I'm not sure I'm going to pay BMW prices for it. I think some people just like that germanic intangible - you get it in a Golf too and to me it conjures up reliabillity issues that seem to pervade every german automaker relentelessly and consistenly. See Bllueguys comments as a 3 owner.

Also the benchmark should not be overlooked by a comepitors cross shopping as the 3 is when G cross shopppers look at the 5 as an alternative.

I'd say the 5 is the benchmark the G strives to become over the next five years and the 3 becomes more inline with the is-300 and accord and saab. Is it pricing or size that matters when class comparing?

The data above is from the Edmunds 2003 sedan comparison test. I apologize for the formatting but it was a copy and paste.
My point here is that sometimes we get overly enthusiastic about what we own and start quoting what we believe to be true in terms of performance, etc. All of these are fine cars and we all have different reasons for buying them.
These are 2003 models. The TL stats have improved for the TL because of the new model. I believe the 330i and the G35 are consistent with the 2004 models as they are running the same motors as 2003 in 2004 ?
The recent Edmunds test for the 04 TL had 0-60 in 6.5 and 1/4 mile in 14.9. G35 for 2004 was 0-60 in 6.1 and 1/4 mile in 14.7. I know the 330i 0-60 was almost identical to the TL. There were some 5.7 times reported for both in recent articles.
The 2003 comparison showed the 330i with the fastest 0-60 time of 6.3. You can find different reviews of these cars with different 0-60 and 1/4 mile times. I believe this is explained by track conditions, tires and skill of the individuals doing the driving. The bottom line for me is that I think you can throw a blanket over these cars in terms of performance in a straight line. It will depend on who is at the wheel. I guess I am disputing the post above which states everyone else will be seeing the LED's of the G 35.
A really interesting part of the test which I had not seen before was the run through the 600 ft slalom course. The 330i won by edging out the A4 and both of these were 2 mph faster than the others. The G35 was last. I don't know if the G35 made changes to suspension or tires for 04.
I just re read the Edmunds test for the 04 TL and the TL went through at 67 mph this year. Quite an improvement from the 03 TL-s 61.3 mph. Edmunds said it was ""one of the fastest cars we've ever taken through the cones"". As a TL owner it shows me that perhaps the rhetoric I constantly hear about RWD being much better handling isn't necessarily true in all instances.
I am looking forward to the ""shoot out"" articles that are surely coming in the auto mags. At least it frames the conversations in facts and data and away from opinion."
545,kdshapiro,"January 27, 2004 5:17PM","raher - just to cite an example. Cars improve every year, so it would be no surprise a FWD of 1980 would be bested by a FWD of 2004. However, having said that, I would like to see how the new ZHP stacks up with the G35 with the SP against the new TL. In the same comparo. Chances are they will best the FWD because of the weight distribution.

It is my belief that the average driver can get more out of a FWD than a RWD. But a RWD driver who has taken performance classes can extract more out of the RWD than a skilled driver can extract out of the FWD.

So to your point, there are advantages and disadvantages of each."

In 99% of every comparison I have ever read apples to apples, the 0-100 and the quarter mile went to the G - that says alot. 0-60 can go to anyone on any given day but the real fun and where my purchase decision was made is winding out 3rd..that is well past 60 mph and where my engine and platform shine and seemingly pull away from all competition. I've seen it on the street and I've seen it in the mags. The G pulls hard and leaves many in awe in 3rd gear (i have 5at).

""As a TL owner it shows me that perhaps the rhetoric I constantly hear about RWD being much better handling isn't necessarily true in all instances.""

No not in all instances but many still. 67 is great for a FWD'er. But since you quote edmunds above here are some other quotes - KDS will enjoy this..""For me, if I'm after a truly sporty sedan, I have to go with the BMW 3 Series"" That is from the editor in cheef after testing the new TL.

Since FWD is for many more than RWD this car should be fine for those folks - there are some more discerning sprts sedan drivers who will avoid this myself included. Driving dynamics are a serious issue in my book and only RWD covers all the performance bases. FWD is too compromising and the reason in the article are stated up front. They are physical laws that cannot be avoided even by japansese engineers at Honda.

There were other comments on edmunds that the TL is great as long as you dont drive an accord first and get a taste of the platform with about the right amount of power and all the great reason to buy an acura but for alot less.

And again, why should the G without SP upgrades be compared to 3 with upgrades. I still will take my chances in 5AT form against one on track and god knows i would in 6MT form. Lets see the G35 with a performance package and then we'll compare again.

Someone mentioned the G was shooting for the stars...dam right and getting there quickly - this is year #2 folks and 5 series has been here for how long. Keep in mind that at 3900 pounds the and similarly sized as G the G is much faster and equally as fast as the 540i.

551,raher,"January 27, 2004 6:14PM","The main point of my post was to emphasize that enthusiasm for the cars we own often clouds reality and opinion is stated as fact. Edmunds didn't say their slalom test result for the TL was good for a FWD car..they said it was one of the fastest they had ever tested.. period. As to race track performance, one of the previous posts said it best...3 series and Integra battle it out for championships in SCCA racing in that class. Your opinion of the G35 is no substitute for facts. Stating that in 99% of the tests you have seen the G35 wins 0-60 and 0-100 doesn't mean anything unless you have an example.
What tests , where. I am sure the G35 has come out on top in some tests just as the 330i has and the TL. I stand by my original statement..you can throw a blanket over them for straight line performance. The differences are in 1/10's of a second. Having gearing that emphasizes torque or speed in 3rd versus 2nd or 4th doesn't matter if you are measuring 0-60 or 0-100 since elapsed time is what is being measured.
Gearing is more important on a race track since the car has to be set up to maximize speed within the confines of the circuit. Having a 160 mph top speed doesn't get you much if the straight only allows 140 mph top end.

The TL-S is much different than the new TL in gearing and motor and weight and CD. I think I'd expect the results you described for your car. Do you have an auto? Read the stats - none of the 04 cars mentioned (545 notwithstanding) are going to be THAT different really. My points about the G are in context of being the new benchmark as opposed to the 3. These differences are not very big but I will suggest they are consistent and in one direction.

That said I would expect the new TL to hang with a 540 pretty well. 6.2 is the 0-60 on 540 right guys?"

566,raher,"January 27, 2004 7:44PM","chris..it appears to me you are the one posting that the G can't be beat but don't have any facts to back it up other than it is your opinion because you really like your car. Everyone gets left behind by someone. I am still not convinced that the G is going to consistently leave the other sedans behind since the data isn't out there yet to back up your opinion. That's what those multi car shootouts do. What will you do when you eventually lose one of those stoplight races because your reaction time was a little slow ? Yell at them that the G 35 is faster but the driver isn't ? There really isn't any point to continue to chant the G 35 mantra since you are the only one who appears to believe it. I am willing to admit that they are all nice cars and have different strengths and weaknesses. I am not willing to admit that any of the sedans being discussed is a clear cut winner over the others.
As to the VQ being the most ""respected"" engine in the $30K class...respected by who..the owner of the car ? Respect isn't something I give to inanimate objects, respect is for people.

You and KD can spar about that. I dont want to break up with my GF and dont want to sit in DC traffic for 3 hours pushing a clutch whenever I go to NC. If the car was slower by more than .2 seconds or handled less - I'd buy that swamp sale. Get over the manual tranny thing - it's old school now that SMG 8 and 9 speeds are on the drawing boards. Personally I hope that I'll always have the choice to go to personally engaging the clutch or not. You are preaching to someone who used to think that way...as far as troucning me - you'll have to be a much better driver and in our hypothetical world these cars are very even. 0-60 you can have if I can have 0-100.

0-60 is not a race - you can have your gearing designed to compete directly with the G and then I can get past you to 100 just like the stats show.

If someone needs me to prove it to them then I'll I have to do is simply READ BACK at all the freaking comps posted already - take a look at each one specifying a 0-100 and quarter. Find any car in class that beats G auto to auto or 6 to 6 and I will concede to you whatever you want. I've been there before and I thought most of you were already there with me.

The G interior was purposefully not too posh - rather industrial and not trying to be BMW while beating the 330i - killing the auto 330i in any timed run, outhandling the 330i, mathcing the 330zhp in handling, beating the 530 matching the 540..and I CAN compare the 5 - the luxury goodies aside the cars have VERY similar sized wheelbases, and displacement.

The G is faster, despite most automotive magazines opinion that they are at least in the same ballpark. The G can be directly compared to the new 5 series, due to the wheelbase. The G has a more visceral feel than the 3/5 series. And the G outhandles and outpaces every 3 series including the M3. But please take this lightly we are all here to have a good time."

We are talking about 1/10 second difference. Let alone different driver with different car although it's the same model/type.

THings changed when the japanese stopped putting G20's out there and called them 3 beaters. You 3ers got used to having no competition - it doesn't suck for the consumer whose a fan of any competitor.

""A 540i automatic driven by someone with poor skills maybe"" I'm sure it was an auto and I'm sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didn't get in the way too bad.

Let's compare a Cayenne Twin-turbo with a G or Z"" This vehicle can dust both of these. On the track/street and off-road. Since it seems not to matter what we are comparing to the G, how much it cost or how much it weighs, let's us this vehicle as a benchmark. Or better yet, let's use an M5 or even an M3, or even a ZHP. Wait, let's even use the new Acura 2004 TL. Since the G/Z platform compares favorably in price, handling, speed, acceleration to every single vehicle, FWD/RWD/NA and forced-air.

""The z has been compared to the GT3 ""

Show me where chris. A vehicle that can go to 60 in under 4 seconds with a top speed of over 200 mph, has been compared to a vehicle that can get to 60 in about 5.5 slower than an WRX/EVO with a lower top speed than a WRX/EVO, has been compared to a GT3? OK. Doesn't make sense to me. But if someone said it, it's gotta be the case.

I'm sure they didn't mean in a straight line, because Nismoed Z is not any more powerful than regular Z. But they meant on a racetrack.

Correct, with mods ala M. Adding a supercharger to the M3, ZHP, with suspension upgrades, would get a commesurate increase in power/handling capabilities as well. Maybe that's why BMW doesn't offer performance upgrades, it wants you to buy their cars. But Nissan needs to compete, because it only has one model. Acura has is R-spec(A-spec) with 300hp. Everybody's doing it."
594,chrisboth,"January 28, 2004 4:04PM","""Correct, with mods ala M""

What? The mods are suspension only in the GT3 comparison! The platforms, horsepower notwithstanding, are the basis for the argument that the 3 is now bested.

It's not a stretch to see why when you look at the global accolades this platform gets. I'd take plain z and a carrera to the track anyday and take my chances in either. That car shares 90% of underpinnings with G. The engine HP wars don't mean a dam thing here you are changing the subject. The platforms being compared are in the same class and the accolades falling on the G and her cousins are telling - with non M type of upgrades KD.

As for the A-spec - still FWD - still low torque - its only another 30hp - another 30 over the accord's that make it 60 too many. I bet those fat sweet tires will help - what are those 295/21's??"
595,biggie2,"January 28, 2004 4:16PM","Why is everyone so worried about if the G is a tad bit better than the 3 series?

Simple truth is, the G or Z will never reach the pinacle of true vehicle perfection that the 3 once had. Nothing could touch it for four or so years there. The 3 series is an old car, the G is much newer. The fact that the 3 series kept atop the extremely competitive automobile industry for so long is a testament to just how good this car really is. As long as BMW doesnt screw this car up, i am sure the next 3 series will blow every competing vehicle away once again.

I personally feel that the advantages of having a G35 over a 3 series is one: price, and two: having a much more rare car. I hardly ever get to see a G, while i probably see two 3 series everytime i go out."

Seems like you like to bring everything into the mix, even though you can't buy it and ride down the street with it. Heck in 2007 I may even be brave enough to go over to the Nissan/Infiniti side of the house. I'm not proud, if BMW can't do it, someone else can. A RWD Acura and better branded RWD Lexus, if done properly, would trounce the Z on the Japan Inc playing field. I hope Nissan is watching, because Lexus knows how to do it and has the cash.

Correct. That's why some people I know instead of buying Lexus, Infiniti, BMW buy Hyundai. Present value of $25,000 for 10 years is what? You don't have to skip buying a 540 to save money, you can skip buying Infiniti also and save a bundle. At the end, buy that M5 for cash.

Come on chris - People who are really serious about saving money, don't even buy cars over $10/$11K, much less buying a BMW or Infiniti."

You can buy any car which suited you best, compare all the goodness and the bad and get the best value of it.

Some people prefer the best brand name in the market, some people like one of the best brand name and others just doesnt care about brand. Best brand name does not always come with more features, more luxury, better performance etc. Besides there is no absolute answer for which brand is actually the best.

They just caught up with the market by making one car G35(Z350), don't forget this is the only car that worth talking, everything else Infiniti builds is a bust.. G35 is not better performance car than 3 series and does not have overall value of TL, I think that infiniti has a long way to go."
606,rderizans,"January 29, 2004 3:03AM","FWIW, I've read the posts over the last few days with some amusement. What a great world we live in if you've got 30-40k to spend on a car, huh? BMW, Audi, Infiniti, Acura, Caddy...whatever, things just keep getting better, huh?

I just traded my 99 328i (E46) for a G35x. I absolutely loved the 328i, but the ABS pump went and I figured the $2500 repair price was a good excuse to go shopping. Before that, the car was rock-solid. Never a problem, really.

The G35x was just the best value for me out there. It's beautiful (IMHO, of course), has AWD, and a GREAT engine (with more power, but not as smooth-revving as my BMW), while also giving me more room than my BMW. Oh, and it was about $6k less than the comparable 3-series today (330ix), although I don't think the $6k is all prestige - there's definitely something special about a 3.

I test-drove the Acura TL and it's a pretty amazing bargain. Didn't care for the FWD feel or the dealers in my area or I'd probably be driving one today. Interior is AMAZING. Puts Infiniti and BMW to shame. During my test drives, for what it's worth, the engine didn't feel as good as the G35's, but a test drive isn't a great place to evaluate such things. Cars need about several thousand miles on them before the engines loosen up.

Anyway, the BMW (with sport and summer tires)felt lighter and more agile than my new G35x, but the G35x feels more powerful and rides better. Both are awesome cars.

One other note about all of the posted ""tests"" from magazines. I love reading about cars, but the comparos really are sometimes apples to oranges. For example, BMWs are always tested with the sport package and summer tires (usually Pilots). Most other cars are tested with all-season tires. Mention is rarely made of that difference. It certainly must account for some of the skidpad and steering response results. In BMW's defense, they have the guts to put top-flite performance tires on their cars so they should get credit...not like the crap Turanza EL42s that came on my G35x.

Anyhow, my overall point is that after having owned a BMW 3 for over five years and extensively test driving an Audi A4, Acura TL, and G35x, I can say that I honestly think I could have been incredibly happy with any of these four cars. If Caddy can get their build-quality up I'm sure they will be another player. For those who don't think there's something special about a 3-series BMW, you really need to own one for a while. I fell in love and might very well find myself back in a BMW down the line. The g35x is a different and amazing car, though, and for me, it's the best of what's out there today.

Heck, even if you're looking in the 25k range you have the Passat, Mazda6, Accord, Altima, and Camry!

Whatever you choose in whichever class, what a GREAT time to be car shopping!!!"

No problem with the latter part of this, about the G35, but the 540i surely isn't in the G's class, it's several classes above it, and in the hands of a skilled driver the G35 doesn't have a prayer with a 540i.

It really doesn't say much for the G to be compared to the Porsche 928, especially since the car was designed in the seventies. There used to be a website called http://www.4car.co.uk/ and they had all kinds of comparos such as the one you've made here. Before their demise they had a test in which the Audi S6 (Euro model only), XJR (pre 04) and M5 were competing with a used to be untouchable Ferrari, the 512TR, which started out as the Testarossa in the 1980's, and guess what...the M5 beat the Ferrari in every measure. Point being that cars simply advance. I don't know what a 350Z would do other than get humiliated by a 911 GT3. I can mention a SL55 AMG in same breath as an Carrera GT in some areas, bit that doesn't mean the SL55 is comparable overall.

I recognize the 5 is a couple notches higher than the G - but I'm stating that performance alone transcends class which is not based on size and displacement, but on lux items and ride quality. Hey I want an M5 as much as anyone..see some of my past posts. The Edmunds home page today has the G-35 review from archives and it specifically mentions the target as the 540i - as well as the m5.

Whoever suggested infiniti has a long way - hello - FX35 and 45 which are porsche beaters fir 40k less, upcoming m45 - which exists in japan now, things we aren't fortuante enough drive here like the Skylines and GTR's ...There's enough here to keep me happy.

Just because Infiniti mentions the 5-Series and M5 as targets doesn't mean they've met those targets, imo and experience with both cars they've fallen short of a normal 5-Series overall and its too surreal to even think about a G35 competeing with a M5.

""Are magazines going to give you the real dirty poop on a car they are paid to advertise?""

I hope they are impartial. That's why I don't based a buying decision on a magazine article. It's just another data point. A first hand reference, others call them anecdotal evidence, means more than the article.

""But you are still getting premium features for your dollars.""

All in all in my experience out of the 5 in a row Japanese vehicles I owned. 1 I had for 2 years, 1 I had for 12 years, and the other 3 were always going back to the dealer for something or another. I'm glad I got rid of them in 3 years. Actually I'll be glad to get rid of the Bimmer. Can't enjoy it lately. Too much traffic and deteriorating roads make it impossible to drive the car 10 feet without hitting fairly large potholes.

Most urban areas suffer from this and it's getting much worse. Some of the benefits to owning and driving today's advanced luxury performance cars are lost to horrendous road conditions. And yet, some of the automakers are designing more cars as if we all drove on race track like roads every day. Here's a good example taken from a recent Car & Driver road test of the new BMW Z4:

""The one major flaw is the way in which the steering wheel dances wildly in your hands from road undulations. This is the downside of the Z4's newfound handling acumen. The taut tuning and unyielding run-flat tires of the Sport-package car mean every truck trough, pavement cyst, and chuckhole takes a yank at the front wheels and, hence, the steering wheel. Versions with the standard suspension should have less bump steer, but all Z4s come with run-flat tires. Sharp-edged pavement will still send a solid enough thwack through the structure to make you wish you'd swerved around the nasty patch."

The Premium Packages tend to be more expensive. So it isn't a question of cost. But you are right about expectations. If you want a serious sport sedan, then you at least have to get the Sport Pkg (or go Perf Pkg or go M). If all you want is a decent car, then Prem Pkg is what many do.

The BMW Sport Pkg is the real sleeper option. Too bad you can't get LSD. To get LSD you have to go M. Not even Perf Pkg adds LSD."

Car A for it's bigger engine does not translate into faster 0-60. 330 according to C&D gets to 60 faster than the TL, braking is superior as well. I believe it also beat the TL in the 1/4 mile. The M3 (which is a 3-series after all) for the same size engine as the TL is another story altogether with it's 4.7 0-60. The TL is a great sporty sedan, if you don't mind a little torque steer. The handling of the 330 is just better. Skidpad is better as well. I doubt the TL will best the slalom of the ZHP though, with it's M3 like handling.

FWD cars when driven hard over heat the front tires and start to push more and more. The torque steer requires more driver effort/attention to manage. Anyone who has raced FWD cars has to learn how to manage the tires and the inevitable mid race increase in push. A RWD car takes a lot less effort to drive at speed and puts less load on the front tires.

As so many have pointed out already there is so much more to cars that what can be measured with 0-60 or a 600ft slalom course. If you took 10 highly skilled drivers and asked them which car (TL or 330) they would take for a little 2 hour race (TL vs 330) I would be surprised if any of them choose the TL.

It does make a difference, I think, but much more so on the 325i than the 330i. The suspension on the 330i is the same, regardless of whether you get the sport package or not (it already has the upgraded suspension). The only chassis-related difference is wheels (same 17"" size, though, I think) and, of course, bigger summer performance tires.

The 325i has a softer base suspension.

Don't get me wrong - the BMW sport pkg (seats!)is great (I had a '99 328i that I just traded in a few weeks ago). I'm just saying that it probably doesn't ""transform"" the car as much as people are saying in the case of the 330i or the coupes (which also come standard with the firmer suspension). And, anyone who has driven a 325i without the sport package and claims it ISN'T fun and still dynamically head-and-shoulders above most of the competition hasn't really driven one. It's still a *great* car.

It has long seemed that when the FWD advocates run out of arguments about why their beloved FWD configuration is superior they always turn to how well their cars perform in snow. Hey, y'all had me fooled to the point where I left behind RWD cars in 1979 and didn't start driving them again until 1999. So, I'll start out with a few well chosen words regarding how much better FWD cars perform in snow vs. RWD cars:

1) Assuming the assertion is in fact true, who cares? I mean, how much snow do you really drive in anyway?
2) Sorry guys, it just ain't so.

According to a very interesting test run a couple of years back by one of the car magazines, it is in fact true that under light acceleration, the FWD car will perform better in snow than an otherwise similar RWD car. Unfortunately for the FWD crowd, that's where the performance advantages end. RWD cars, with their naturally better balance (ie. fore/aft weight distribution) reigned supreme in the handling and braking department (AWD cars were a different story, however, the RWD cars, with their lighter relative weight still stopped better). After all, who cares about getting going if you cannot stop or turn?

I am now driving a RWD car with a nearly perfect 50/50 weight distribution, traction control and winter tires, and I can say without a doubt that it is the finest winter weather driving car I have ever driven. Given what Chris Bangle has done to BMW, I have no idea what my next car will be, however, I can assure you that even though I live in snowy New Hampshire, it will be RWD.

2) Lexus: 53.2%
3) Acura: 52.1%
4) MB: 52%
5) Audi: 51.2%
6) Infiniti: 51.1%

I got a question. If the average BMW sells for 95% of MSRP, and the average Infiniti sells for 90% of MSRP, aren't real world resale values approximately the same (51.1/90 = 54.5/95 = 57%)?"
740,riez,"February 5, 2004 6:29PM","jrock65... Those are purely ""guestimates"". The actual numbers won't be know for years when real owners go to sell their cars or trade them in. The industry has done a horrible job projecting depreciation (which impacts both leases and non-lease purchases) for the past decade or more. Trend had been to inflate. Plus manufacturers sometimes artificially inflate residual in order to subsidize the lease. Then they take a bath 3 years down road when their dealers are wholesaling the lease returns.

Realized depreciation really best applies to the person who buys the car new and then sells it later. Their actual realized depreciation is the difference between what they actually paid (which is usually below MSRP) and what they actual get for resale (which is usually below the published books). MSRP is normally meaningless to depreciation unless that is the price paid at time of purchase."
741,jrock65,"February 5, 2004 6:59PM","Yes, these are estimates, but I don't believe that they're worthless. If I'm buying a car now, there's no way to know for sure what it'll sell for in the future. These estimates do serve as some sort of guide, however imperfect they are.

The tense of my question should be in the future tense."
742,riez,"February 5, 2004 7:03PM","Guess it really depends on whether you plan on leasing or buying and how long you plan on keeping the car. These guestimates won't matter a whit if you buy the car outright, keep it for a decade, and drive the wheels off of it. Nor will they matter if you are leasing and get a great subsidized lease deal from the manufacturer, where they deliberately over-estimate residuals in order to lower less payment.

Of course, these estimates do matter when it comes to calculating a lease deal today. But I've never leased and can't imagine ever doing so.

But I also think these estimates can be dangerous for people who buy and then plan on trading in or selling off their car in say 2-5 years. These numbers are almost always over what you will actually receive from a dealer or private party. To be safe, deduct at least an extra 10% if not more like 25%.

Give you an example. On 11/30/01 I bought a CPO '98 540i6. Had about 52K miles. Original MSRP was around $58K. I paid about $36K. I traded her in 9/03 at about 78K miles. Got about $19K from dealer. So my actual depreciation for the 22 months and 26K miles I owned her was about $17K. The dealer who bought it from me sold it for about $22K. So the car at 78K miles/5 years was worth a bit over a 1/3 what she went for new/actually paid in '98.

Then they didnt even question this remarkable improvement??

They go on to say that the 330i beats the CLS due to its performance advantage. But when you look at the numbers, they give the CLS a better rating for the engine, a better rating for the transmission and an equal rating for handling.

The fact is TL just had the best sales month in history in Jan, and this is the 3rd gen TL. For a time it was the best selling entry luxury car, and the new one got the record right out of the gate. I'd call that a trend and an exceptionally good start.

769,riez,"February 11, 2004 1:12PM","mariner7... My only points are (1) SUVs have become a clear trend even in premium marques like BMW and Lexus, (2) there can be intra-marque sales competition (e.g., the X3 and 3 Series take sales from each other as do the RX330 and ES330), (3) there is inter-marque competiton (potential buyers who didn't like the new 7 Series might go for the S Class or people who think the 330i is too expensive might buy a G35), and (4) you have to take into account general economic and social trends (e.g., in general recessions cause sales to fall and buyers have moved away from sedans and station wagons into SUVs and light trucks).

Road Test
Subaru Legacy 3.0Rn
 
No Longer An Outcast
by Ross Finlay (10 Nov 03)

In previous years, Subaru's suggestion that with the latest Legacy it's targeting the ""leading prestige European marques"" would have seemed like PR spin from Cloud Cuckoo Land. But since the 2004 model range offers smoothed-out exterior styling, greatly improved interior presentation, a more powerful top-of-the-range engine and even more precise handling, you'd better believe it.

Subaru may not be the class of the field when it comes to premium badge recognition, but the lighter-weight 2004 model, which goes on sale this month, sits even more four-square on the road thanks to its wider track, modified suspension and lowered powertrain.

Together with revisions to the steering and brakes, lower front and rear roll centres, and the advantage of four-wheel drive, all this means that the top-rated 3.0R feels to have similarly priced European saloons and estates beaten hands-down for handling.

I can't think of any immediate competitors at prices in the mid-£20,000 to £30,000 range which could match them for poise and traction on winding or hilly roads.

The three-litre Legacy is the best-balanced car in its class. Driven briskly, it's stable and precise on corners, and there's no need to throw it about rather than hold it on line. Out on the open road, anybody who feels the VDC cutting in - unless during an emergency attempt to miss the tractor - ought to blush at being so ham-handed.

As I said before, if you have driven a Legacy you know you don't have to worry about keeping up with Audi's, BMW's, G35's or TL's in the twisties. The 3.0r might be getting the 6spd MT from the STI according to Subdriven.com"

Audi? rofl. Audi's A4 Cab is a joke. It's straight up not a sports sedan/coupe. BMW is the only player in the entry level sports coupe convertible market. With everything from the underpowered 325cic to the monsterous M3 convertible, they have the market to themselves.

I'll be amazed if Infiniti doesn't show off a G convertible for the 2005 MY. It's a no brainer given the way the G sells vis a vis the 3.

You'd end up with a 2 seat car. Again that's not competition for the 330cic and for the dough it's not nearly as nice of a car.

A super sprty sedan or coupe is compromised by the top being gone so

The compromise is slight if the engineering is solid. We're talking a marginal weight penalty and if the engineers designed it as a convertible from the start, then the chassis flex is not that much of a difference. 10-20 years ago this wasn't true. Today many sports cars are made from the ground up as convertibles - Z8, Viper, etc.

Have you seen the times on that bloated cow? It's a 4k lbs beast with an underwhelming engine.

Nobody is seriously challenging BMW's dominance of 4 place entry lux RWD convertibles. We know buyers are grabbing up G35 coupes and sedans. So a convertible is the next sensible step in Infiniti's quest to steal BMW's thunder.

I think the 1/4 mile is a good test because it mitigates the different gear ratios which distort the 0-60 test (the TSX needs 3rd gear to reach 60 MPH), and lets both HP and TQ come into play.

I don't like the ""top gear"" tests because 5-speed cars have a 1.00 ratio while the 6-speed cars have a much taller ratio (the Saab has .62 in 6th gear, and .75 in 5th).

I think a test that shows 50-70 and 30-50 (isn't this just second gear?) from the optimum gear would tell us more about the cars. Owners quickly figure out how to squeeze the fun from their engines.

Most 5-speed manuals are also overdrive. The IS300 is overdrive. The IS300's overdrive just isn't very deep (believe it is around .85). There are some exceptions. BMW tends to use a non-overdrive 5th gear in their close ratio boxes, but has also used an overdrive in their wide ratio boxes.

You also have to factor in the differential's final drive ratio. The higher the number the quicker the acceleration (but the lower the top speed).

The wonders of engine torque multiplication!

The value of the ""top gear"" data is in regard to showing whether you'll have to downshift in order to pass. The cars with the real deep overdrives (say .70 or lower numerically) normally will have to downshift to 5th or even 4th.

""Top gear"" test also is somewhat indicative of how much torque the engine produces in its power band.

You might also compare C&D's observed and EPA estimated fuel economy numbers. Holding all other factors constant, the cars with the deepest overdrives will (normally) get the best fuel economy and turn over the lowest engine revs at high speeds for relaxed high speed cruising.

The former Acura TL Type-S a great example. Believe it used a 4.11 final drive and a .47 5th gear overdrive. Great initial acceleration and great fuel economy."

Without 6th gear, the ""30-50"" and ""50-70"" numbers for the sub-3.0L cars would all be within a couple 1/10ths of each other (hence the similar 1/4 mile times)."
825,blueguydotcom,"February 17, 2004 4:02PM","The value of the ""top gear"" data is in regard to showing whether you'll have to downshift in order to pass.

Need to? need? I don't want to take 7 or even 5 seconds to go from 50 to 70. I want to change gears. I want to use the power of my car. I bought a six speed manual for a reason - to exploit the power of the car.

If I'm stuck behind some tool doing 50 I look forward to dropping to third and rocketing by the guy. there's nothing troublesome about that as that's why I bought a car with this much power and a manual.

The cars with the real deep overdrives (say .70 or lower numerically) normally will have to downshift to 5th or even 4th.

I'll take third thanks. I can pull to almost 100 in 3rd so at 60 the car rockets.

""Top gear"" test also is somewhat indicative of how much torque the engine produces in its power band.

At 50 mph in 6th I'd be turning somewhere near 2k RPM. Who drives a car sporting a 7k redline with the engine down there?"
826,blueguydotcom,"February 17, 2004 4:04PM","TSX runs better than the saab. I'd rather have it and the IS300 looks better in top gear stats as it's a 5 speed i believe.

That's part of the reason the test is bogus. I've driven both cars and the TSX's 6 speed is like butter. Moving to 3rd from 6th is a pleasure and allows the driver to exploit the TSX's spritely little 4. Superb engine and tranny."
827,chrisboth,"February 17, 2004 4:29PM","TSX to me is a better deal than TL for sure! If only I were younger, smaller and not in traffic. If they had one in 1993 I would have jumped on it.

Although I have not had much luck with acura/honda cars and tranny's as I am way too demanding on their little motors ancd beat the tar out of them, I get the sense the TSX would be up to the task and is a little more than the RSX in capability and fun factor."
828,riez,"February 17, 2004 7:57PM","blueguydotcom... Is more of a European thing. BMWs, MBs, etc. often used close-ratio (non-overdrive) 4th or 5th gears to ensure adequate response in all gears.

I don't mind downshifting to pass. And I'd rather have better highway fuel economy.

But I will admit it is nice to be driving my '04 IS300 manual in 5th gear and come upon a slower car. I can immediately pass without having to shift. Did same with my former '98 540i6 (believe it had only a .82 6th overdrive)."
829,chrisboth,"February 17, 2004 8:03PM","I have no issues passing a doof going 40 in a 70 in top gear in the G, but like Blueguy me thinks its funner downshifting to 3rd.

My philosophy is why not hammer the motor - its the one thing that prob will last the longest and you can have more fun too. If when I pass I can get down another gear - WHY NOT. I have a hard time not enjoying all the acceleration this baby's got. If there is any reason to downshift I cant help it - I am addicted to feeling the thrust."

From my perspective, the CTS is even further down that road, and as such there is no way I would own either of them, even if they had 1000 hp and cost $15K.

Looked at another way; if I were to have opted for the E39 540i instead of my 530i, which really is fast enough, I would be quite happy with the wonderful performance and driving dynamics, regardless of how many folks were out there driving CTS-Vs. Their drivers might well be laughing at me because of my slow 540i; however, I would be laughing right back at folks driving such hideous looking cars. So, who's right? Neither and both, whatever floats your boat.

http://thecarconnection.com/index.asp?article=6866&sid=173&am- p;n=156

""Quality problems are still dogging VW vehicles and putting off customers who were attracted to VW in the late 1990s, costing VW big on warranty repairs and marketing costs to keep old customers and lure new ones. Last year, for example, VW began offering costly lease-pull-ahead deals to owners in order to keep them from defecting. In Europe, the company is offering deals like free air conditioning to move a large inventory of Golfs, and similar measures are anticipated in North America. VW stock initially rose 2.7 percent Wednesday, but then gave ground and closed at 39.33 euros ($50.49) or less than one percent in Frankfurt. Shares are down 11 percent since early January. VW is offering discounted finance rates and leases in North America, but has stayed away from big rebates. Most models have rebates of just $500. And it is facing pressure from dealers to be more generous on discounts to move aging models like the New Beetle (five years old), Golf and Jetta (six years old), and Passat (five years old). VW's discounts are more in line with Japanese and European imports than with U.S. automakers. But it doesn't have the premium image of its European mates, nor the high-reliability image of its Asian rivals."""

Nobody said VW doesn't have quality issues. They do, but I don't think their product is as bad as you are making it out to be. VW has an older product line and they are not discounting their cars, and that is why they are being taken to the cleaners by the American and Japanese manufacturers. I was very familiar with VW/Audi products way before I owned one (I hang out at VWvortex a lot). I chose Audi because they are better made and more reliable than their VW counterparts.

Differnt values at each co I agree. BUT the new GS and the new IS will change that as well as the cool hybrids and LX470 trucks that youger blingers want. Style is subjective. They sell em without a discount so the ugly aspect isn't there if objectively speaking...and performance will change in fact those co's that put hybrid front drives with gas rear drives in the same car will outperfrom everyone.

I'm not convinced Infiniti has gotten lexus credibility just yet - they just found a young buyers niche only 2 years ago...those weren't young people in those Q's and I's that I saw over the last decade..maybe g20 and then most young people went right to the sentra and saved 15k!"

4. All around performance (subjective issue but to me TL is more than just acceleration, slalom 600 67.4 mph). In fact I dont do any of the above just to test my guts, but I know what this car has, so it's kinda comforting thought

5. resale value
   Dont know yet, Acura/ honda always has a good resale value but with all the improvement I think it would be better. with the car's demand is so high, do you think resale value would be bad?

6. Value / what's standard or optional.
   TL comes with 2 prices, 1 with nav and the other without. everything else is standard.

7. simplicity
I guess TL is about simplicity, just voice command it, its faster than having tons of buttons to press"

874,bxd20,"February 24, 2004 3:00AM","Well, engineering can overcome certain aspects of FWD (torque steer elimination by careful axle length design, wheel spin out of corners with an LSD) but no engineering can overcome the laws of physics.

I think we're all familiar with a tire's contact patch. All forces work through it. When you expect the front two tires to deal with lateral forces of turning AND acceleration/decceleration, the tire becomes overburdened more quickly than with RWD where the fronts just have to roll along and steer.

This type of performance handicap doesn't show up in most performance tests. Acceleration numbers are all straight-line. Skidpad g's are maximized under light throttle adjustments, so it doesn't show up too much there. In slalom, a car's ""normal"" transient behavior is explored and how quickly it can shift back and forth, but the driver is hardly turning left and right in a way that fully collapses the suspension. More importantly though, just like the skidpad tests, the slalom is done with just enough throttle to maintain a smoothe constant speed.

If you want to see where RWD reigns superior over FWD, look at track lapping times. This is where the driver must brake hard, turn in, and blast through and out of the corner. The RWD will be able to get on the gas earlier and harder and gain tenths through the corners. This mimics aggressive street driving more closely than any skidpad/slalom.

As one Sports Car International writer noted (Ted West, 1/02 issue, p. 19): ""in the presence of anything more than puny horsepower, [FWD] torque steer is just plain abominable and something had to be done about it. As with Audi, Volvo believes the answer is [AWD].""

As far as the lapping times are concerned, I don't have much data here at work with me, I will have to take a look at home. I would be willing to bet that the Integra you cite did not have the same power to weight ratio as those RWD cars. My point was -all else being equal- a RWD chassis will be faster around a track.

When super-car builders (Ferrari, Ford GT, Lambo) set out to build an exotic high end sports car, they do so with very little concern for cost. If FWD was inherently equal to or better than RWD, why wouldn't one of them have tried it already? Is Honda on to some sort of voo-doo front wheel drive that nobody else knows about?

And reading over C&D's comparo, it sounds like Acura still has a ways to go till they have the TL handling at its full potential. It finished third because of a wonderful interior and much more power than anybody else. For -me-, the interior is almost irrelevant, any car in this class is good enough. The straight line power is intoxicating and enticing.

I smell a mild suspension update in the next year or two for the TL.

People's needs may vary as they grow up, if a teenager might prefer a more sportier car like an EVO/STI. Fast fast fast, Luxury/comfort doesnt mean anything. Because they have a lot of time to play with their car or even going to a race track. I was young too.

In my mid 30s, I prefer half sport and half comfort, but if I am over 45, I might go for a total comfort/luxury car.

If you try Nissan maxima or Integra GSR you will feel a noticeable understeer. I am not saying that understeer doesnt exist in a TL but you cant hardly feel it unless you really go too far. ""This time Acura has done a bit too far for a FWD car"" quoted. Do you know what they meant by saying that? I tried Nissan maxima and 2000 Integra GSR (and its nothing compared to TL), and it's totally a different experience but still better than the previous altima. There are 5 current report that gave the nod to the new TL, do you think they all dont know about understeer?.

Performance rating in a scale of 1 to 10, RWD may get a 10 while normal FWD usually get 6. If a FWD can get an 8 (G35=10,BMW=9, TL=8), for me that's more than enough while it gets more rating for luxury/comfort/styling/acceleration/snow/mpg/resale value/ maintenance cost, considering that people dont take on corner very often in their life or doing it in a race track. Besides road styles, traffics in everyday's life dont support those kind of adventure.

Austere is fine. Cold and detached is fine. Doors that are super light (like the nasty BMW X3) or trim that feels brittle (like the Nissan Altima's dash) don't do it for me.

901,raher,"February 25, 2004 5:00PM","I have been staying out of here for awhile but have been reading most everything. One of my observations is that there are very few women participating. The posts about women could take on on another aspect...do your wives or women friends drive your car and what do they think about the TL and others? Most of the posts here are from men and are performance oriented. Women are responsible for a large portion of the money spent in our economies. I recently read a report that said they were responsible for the majority of the discretionary money spent.
I bought our new TL for my wife. It is the third car I have purchased for her. She never test drives them or participates in the selection. All three have been Acura's. A '91 Legend, a 2000 TL and now an '04 TL. I always look for a car that is a cross between sport and luxury. I am the sport, she is the luxury. She loves the new TL, including the 270 HP. She isn't out racing but is in the car all day driving ( sales job ). The power comes on gradually and is very predictable.
She loves the ""near luxury"" especially the seats and the stereo. The NAV is an absolute necessity as she is constantly having to drive to unfamiliar places. The real thing is she looks very nice in that silver/ebony car and people are constantly telling her what a nice car she drives. On the weekends I get to use the sport piece of the equation. The new TL is a perfect blend for the two of us. After 36 years of marriage I have a pretty good idea of what her expectations are.
I laughed when I read the thread about ""old people"" ( anyone over 30 evidently )not pushing their cars but buying cushy luxury cars. Not always so. I am 58 and still enjoy driving fast and aggressive where it is safe to do so. I started road racing motorcycles at 38. My brother is 60 and has a V8 powered Triumph TR7. Next time your at a light and the guy next to you is in a BMW/TL/??? he may just be like me and decide to have a go. Paul Newman raced well into his 60's.

But let's say your budget doesn't allow that and you're looking to spend $50k. At that price point, I would be looking at cars such as used M5s, new M3s, a Z06, a CTS-V. I wouldn't ""demerit"" the sedans just because they're sedans. I'd look at overall performance and upon doing so I'd see that the M5 and CTS-V BELONG in the company of ""sports cars"".

As for the sound thing, I'm baffled as to why people think it's out of sorts to want your car to be whisper quiet on the inside.

Currently I drive a 2003 330i with the Performance Package. The muffler makes a constant, droning rasp that reminds me of my sister's first Miata on long drives to So Cal with the top down. The other bimmers I've ridden in are quieter but still there's too much road and wind and engine noise.

It's not too hard to figure out what I prefer given what I bought. The G35 came in 3rd in my choices as I didn't dig the sloppy suspension or typical truck-like Nissan manual. Acura's TL with a 6 speed probably would have come in second as I would have even taken a TSX 6 speed over the G35.

Nothing else was even close as, the Lexus IS bored me with numb steering, a lackluster engine and a very, very bad image in so cal (teen brats drive IS300s around here - the rich kids Jetta\?Accord).

if its too quiet, you can't tell what is going on. By the pull of the engine? Ok, so how does that translate as to when to shift? When it stops pulling that means you've hit the rev limiter, so you should shift??

This is one of those things that you should be careful what you ask for because you might get it. I am sure that if you got your wish and had a completely silent car, you wouldn't have a clue what is going on without looking at the guages. Maybe after quite some time with the car, you could get used to what speed objects are traveling past you to trigger your shifting, but it would not be intuitive from the start and would take alot of conditioning.

I am driving a perfect example now. I am currently stuck with a rental 2004 Maxima with the shiftronic.

No I still bought a car with a very bad public image. That fact weighed heavily on my mind before making the trip back to the dealer.

Driven two and I'd say the steering is numb. To each his own. You can go round and round on the subjective but neither side can win what feels right to them and not to another. You like it, as Chris likes the road feel of the G35. That's why they make more than just vanilla ice cream.

I'd sooner drive just about anything over a 325i. I think it's a rip off. Why pay 30k for a car with no guts and bad worksmanship? It'd be like owning a VW/Audi again.

So a Toyota Altezza transplant with an iron block 3.0 inline 6 will be a collector's car? Okey dokey. Wishful thinking?

The lack of power and poor steering feel played the biggest role in my decision to pass on an IS. The car didn't excite me. Unlike the G, TSX and BMW 330i, I wasn't smiling while driving the IS... actually I only wanted to get out of it both times.

The desperation of the Lexus dealership who dropped the price to invoice made me uneasy as they called back over and over with lower offers. He was begging me to buy the car. Creepy. Finally, seeing 16-24 year old boys exclusively driving the Lexus IS reminded me of why I passed on the Integra GS-R in 97.

I had the misfortune of piloting a 5 speed CTS with the old engine. It had the so-called sport packaging too. The car bobbed and undulated on hard corners. The interior was a mess, exterior not much better. The dealership seemed really enamored with it being a Caddy. When he asked if I'd buy one I said it lacked the punch and sublime road feel of the German targets. This tool asserted the CTS competes against no one as it's a Caddy. Okay, I guess only pimps would be interested in it then...dunno. He also scoffed at my request for a manual - even though they had one - as he felt Caddies shouldn't have a manual.

When I said ""raw power"", I meant to convey the general ""pull"", or ""kick"" of the car, especially as a reference to 0 to 60 feel. Sorry wrong choice of words.

Also, that 220 you quote is for the 3.2 CTS. The new 3.6 is 255 hp / 252 lb ft torque. That's why I said earlier it will be in the same ballpark as the fastest other RWDs in this class. Of course that's all ""paper racing"", it will be interesting to see what MT or C&D say.

""The Lexus' steering, on the other hand, is exemplary. Not only is it exceptionally tight and precise, with just the right level of power assist at all speeds, but it gives immaculate feedback, as well. The steering wheel itself is fat but small in diameter, and with no supplemental controls save the [AT] gearshift buttons, it's nicely uncluttered, as well. It's perfectly capable of communicating precise information about how much grip is available from the front, what the road surface is doing to the chassi, how much angle is dialed into the wheels, etc.""

40? My car has 235 HP...regardless.

It's the same car, same tranny, same poor BMW reliability.

Actually I have a short-shift 6 speed. Again not the same. Oh and different suspension and different wheels and different differential. Different chip programming. Lets toss in wholly different exhaust system and headers/cams. Oh and my speed is limited to 155 (which I hope one day to try out on a track) rather than 123 (I believe that's the ceiling for the 3 series normally) and my redline is 6800 which is higher than a 325i.

In addition to the performance upgrades from the 325i to the 330i ZHP, I also got a few luxury features I've grown to love...memory seats, tilt mirror. Useless fluff to some but the difference between me happily leaving my car for a wash and being annoyed I have to adjust everything back.

And unless you are a stoplight racer for a living the 0-60mph difference is inconcequential.

I don't know where you live but in So Cal we have annoying freeway lights. 100-200 feet to go from zero to 75.

Am I a stop light racer? No. Do i consistently shift my in the upper region where the engine sings. Redline shifts are common for me on every drive. I bought a performance sedan and I make it perform. I often cruise in 3rd of 4th at around 80 mph so that when the need arises I can punch it and take off. This cannot be done with a 325i. Ask my bro-in-law as he and his 325i simply cannot keep up with my bone stock car.

The 325i has enough power to move that car very well. I personally, think they are both a ripoff, and that's why I went with an A4...but the 330 is by far the biggest insult to one's intelligence.

To each his own. The A4 doesn't offer the handling (especially a FWD one) or power I want when spending over 30k for a car. There's no reason I should EVER have to worry about merging or will I have enough power to shoot a gap if I'm in a near luxury sport sedan. With the A4 (I had a 1.8T) the engine pulls pretty well but not with the ferocious authority I'd expect paying over 30k. Go Quattro and an already slow car is now saddled by an inefficient drivetrain that saps power like crazy. Add the tiptronic and the car's dead in the water.

We all have priorities. Mine were performance, luxury and fun for a price I found reasonable. As the 325i only offered good handling it didn't meet my performance to price ratio. I'd gladly blow 40k again on my sedan as it's a grin producer. The 325i wasn't that big of a step up from my old Jetta. I couldn't rationalize spending 30-32k for a 325i that would leave me constantly annoyed at the lack of punch."

Which means that my response was accurate, if you add back in as much as possible to bring the 325i up to the level of the 330i, you need to add:

Sport Package: $1,400

No it didn't. That's a typical misrepresentation of the facts. BMW owners do it too. Get a 330i and then add the sport package and 18 inch rims and wheels. At this point you're now talking about a 2k difference for an engine that's modified, modded tranny, different suspension, different interior/exterior treatment. Heck Acura and G35 owners pay 2k just to get cosmetic changes to their cars!

Mine is a 1.8T Frontrack and CVT. The car pulls with tremendous authority and the CVT is a awesome tranny. Previous to my A4, I had a 2K Nissan Maxima (I like a car with power) and I am very impressed with the power of and fuel economy of the 1.8T engine. BTW...I live in S. Florida.

I'm glad you like it. I couldn't live with a CVT or the 1.8T engine again. They're gorgeous cars with excellent interiors and the 1.8T pulls nicely.

When it comes to what I prefer with my money I don't even understand how you'd have the temerity to toss up journalists as to proof a vehicle should feel a certain way to me. I never said the rest of the world should bow down to the BMW or Acura or any car. I expressed my opinion on what was worth my money.

Why would I or anyone else take into consideration what dozens of others might have indicated in their published reports when you have spoken?

I honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags. Or reviews of anything. I judge for myself and make my decision from there. Experience for yourself and build your opinions from that. Repeating quotes from car mags is nothing more than parroting the opinions of someone else. You can tell me X car is horrible but I must experience it for myself.

Good example, I'm a huge movie buff. I've had netflix for near 4 years. I see movies constantly (watch zero TV) and because of my love for film I'll give just about everything a shot - b movies, iranian film, japanese, so-called bombs, etc. With some friends one night we saw an ad for Swept Away on pay-per-view. The common consensus among critics it was horrible. Someone snorted, ""who would see that?!"" I said I had on DVD and it was quite bad. Another friend added, ""Leave it to you to confirm that the universally hated film was bad."" It wasn't good enough that others liked it or disliked it, I had to experience it firsthand.

There can be differences in two cars. Often one test drive isn't enough. Some specific single cars are lemons. Others just aren't up to the rest. Deviations from the mean.

That's why I've driven two of them. You can keep trying but in my experience with the IS300, the car felt numb and disconnected. The engine didn't offer the power I prefer. Like it or not, these are my opinions and I will not deviate from tham."
958,riez,"February 28, 2004 3:00PM","blueguydotcom... Having owned a '98 540i6 and a '00 323ia, I have some appreciation for BMW steering systems. I've also test driven 318ti, E39 525i, E46 325xi, Z3, X5, E65 745i, etc. (Have you ever done the Susan B. Kosman Drive for the Cure? It is a blast.) I didn't mind fact E39 540i used recirculating ball instead of rack & pinion in the E39 525i/530i. Both work quite well. But I also own two IS300s, an automatic and a manual. The steering in the IS is every bit as good as that in the E39 or E46 BMWs. It is not numb. Nor disconnected. And if it is, then I guess so, too, must be the BMWs?

This is opinion based on actual comparative ownership. Not just a short test drive or two. (I also loved the steering in my former Infiniti G20t and my former Lincoln LS8 Sport.)

I find your following comment fascinating:

""I honestly don't know why anyone believes a word written in car mags. Or reviews of anything.""

Winter is not exactly the best time to sell a sports coupe or a convertible, for example.

I'm sure the TL did much better this month when compared to its sales in Feb 2003, but you also have to consider it is an outgoing model vs. a brand new model comparision.

But if I'm a TL owner, I wouldn't necessarily be happy with this, since this means that there are TL's all over the place.

It seems the Maxima increased in sales by a bit (5200). For many Nissan buyers, the Maxima is a viable alternative to the G35 if one is willing to sacrifices some sport for room and FWD (for snow), and is not willing to pay extra for AWD. A fully loaded Maxima and a G35 offer similar features for almost the same price.

BMW sold 2492 325i and 467 330i. This isn't surprising since the 3 is near the end of its model run. Sales will pick up when the next 3 is introduced, but BMW will have to do an excellent job. The TL has been a big success, the G35 will only get better with the redone interior, and Lexus seems serious about the next IS. 3-series domination is no longer a gimme in this segment, as it once used to be.

That's an interesting thing. You're basically saying the Infiniti which hasn't enjoyed good sales over the past 10 years isn't doing well by moving 50-60k units of the G. Most struggling manufacturers would love to offload 30-40k cars in those kind of numbers.

I'd say both cars are a hit. Fair enough?

I'm just itching for an AWD TL 6 speed by May 2006. I couldn't stomach a wrong wheel drive car, so maybe Acura will meet enthusiasts half way with AWD and give us a reason to defect. Ideally let us split the power with a CPU ala the WRX STi...85% rear, 15% front...oh yummy."

In fact in edmund 2002-2003 comparison G35 couldnt outsell the previous 3.2 TL, and considered a tie(if not second) after BMW. How can a G35 win over the new TL, how absurd.

I like stirring the pot lol, tee hee .."
982,jrock65,"March 3, 2004 6:39AM","""G35 is not as fast as TL""

Disagree. The C&D comparo found the TL to be faster 0 to 60, but the average of the entire sample of tests seems to say that the two cars are a dead heat 0 to 60, and the G35 is slightly faster in the 1/4 mile.

""G35 is not as well equipped like TL""

Depends. The G has some features that the TL lacks, and vice versa. Personally, I prefer the exclusive features of the G, since Bluetooth, DVD-audio, and voice operation (Navi isn't worth it) is useless to me.

""G35 is cheaper than TL""

The base G is cheaper than the TL. But very, very few people get the base G. Similarly configured, the G35 costs a bit more. But I would think that this is a plus for the TL, not a minus.

""G35 is not as luxy as TL""

If by ""luxy"" you mean better interior, then yes.

""G35 does sell less than TL""

No doubt about it.

""G35 is not as high tech as TL""

Yes, the TL has more ""high tech"" features.

Again, I really like the TL and would personally get it over the G35 (depending on how good the 2005 G35 interior changes are.) I just don't think that either is ""better"" than the other in any quantitative sense of the word."

Both of these cars are great, naturally you have to open with that line.

The TL looks better (imo), has a better interior, is a hair faster, is fwd (+/- depending) and has more features.

The G35 handles better, stops better, and is rwd (+/- depending).

I think it's really pointless to argue reliability here. Neither will match that ""other"" Japanese luxury brand, per the surveys. They are both competing for 2nd place here.

Price is pretty much a non-issue too, at least around here.

I think it comes down to whether you want more luxury/features or more performance (straight-line speed isn't everything) and rwd handling characteristics.

Neither one of these cars clobbers the other overall.

I must admit I've never seen the FX or Murano interior in person so I can't comment on their quality, but I was referring to the common styling theme that Nissan is following right now. Overall, it's not where I would want to spend much time.

I like BMW's so much (pre-Bangle) because their design/styling is purposeful. They look and feel the way they do because it's the most efficient way for the car to go about it's business...no unecessary scoops, curves, grooves, etc.

As for my TSX...I'm loving it. Now that it's got some miles on the clock, the engine has really opened up and it breathes like a sprinter. I swear if it didn't have a fuel cut-off at 7500, it would zing up to 10,000 without a problem! The cold temperatures also make a big difference with that big I-4!

I sometimes regret not biting the bullet and getting the BMW, not so much for it's driving experience, since the TSX satisfies very nicely. It's just that I originally wanted something different (non-Japanese), and my smarter side ruled against it. You know, what I really want is a cherry, 1989 325is to play with (sport suspension, BBS rims...oohhh). It really is the best sport sedan BMW ever made (or at least, my favorite) and I'd buy one tomorrow if it crossed my path!

Like you, my sport sedan only comes out on weekends, so it is much more fun to drive because every drive ""feels like the first time.""

I must tell you though, we got a new Volvo V70 for munchkins in January and I really enjoy driving it! Smooth ride, Barkalounger seats, and it just looks cool!

As a friend pointed out one day, I even refer to the BMW as ""my car"" and the other car (the one I own) I call the commuter or by its name. It's the redheaded stepchild in my automotive family.

1007,victord1,"March 4, 2004 7:53AM","I believe I posted a message sometime waaaaaaay back, about six months ago, about my personal experience with both cars. My sister and I own both the '03 Max SE and '03 TL-S. The TL-S has slight advantages in handling, smoother ride, smoother engine at high RPM, and possibly exterior look. I like the Max interior ergonomics, quieter engine, smoother trans/engine interactions (both cars have slush box), and bigger size.

To most people, both cars are about equal overall, except for $2,000-$4,000 differences in prices, w/incentives on the Max.

Now I haven't test-driven the '04 TL yet, but I assume that the new smaller size and slightly more powerful engine would increase its performance/handling potentials even further. I tested the '04 Max the first day it arrived in the dealer and noticed that while the engine was even smoother/quieter than the '03 and the drive had been improved with the new rear ind. suspension set-up, the car's bigger size reduced the handling part to just marginally better than the '03. And don't even get me started with the new interior.......what the heck were they thinking?!?!

When the new '06 BMW 3series come out in late '05, I'll probably trade in the Max for the ""older"" version '05 3's. Personally I think the current 3series has the best overall exterior look (especially in titanium silver) and the size is just about right for me--yes, I've grown tired of the bigger Max. Now if I can only get pass the BMW reliability issues......oh well, then there's always a TL :-)"

While I might not have thought this if I drove just the 325, after driving the 330 the 325 power seemed nice, but not great. Of course, in most cases, not a real issue.

I'm off (in the near future) to drive a G35x. On paper, looks like I can have 330 power for less than 325 price, at a higher level of equipment (cd changer, leather, and still less than the 325). Recent years' reliability looks comparable.

Nothing else looks close to these two to me (Audi has some reliability issues, I think. No Volvo dealer nearby, and not so sporting,...)

AWD is a must have.

For someone who's looking for a family sedan with room and power to spare, the Max is an excellent choice. However, for a single guy like me who likes corners and twisties, a more agile and smaller sedan would be more preferable.

When it's time for my trade-up, the only cars I have in mind are the new TL , the G35/G35X, possibly the up-coming 250Hp AWD Subaru (for the AWD factor), and the 3series as the most favorite. I like almost everything about the car, except reliability.....sorry, didn't mean to sound like a broken record :-)"
1018,designman,"March 4, 2004 7:14PM","What I like about the G35 is the overall shape... numero uno in judging appearance IMO. It has a fluid airfoil shape, similar to the 911. Also, none of the details and proportions scream for attention. I think they could have done a better job with the headlights and grille though. Headlights say Maxima, grille says Cadillac.

TL has subtle details but is too wedgy and chunky in the rear. Accordingly the shape is a bit unbalanced. And that swathe running just beneath the beltline looks like an afterthought... incongruous. I'd bet they added that near the deadline after thinking the car looked too vertical... to give the impression of less height. The wedge works better with smaller cars like TSX and RSX. By the way, on the Acura website, they do a great job of reducing the chunky rear with lighting… notice how dark the bumper is in all shots. But when it comes out into real available light, the butt is very large. I&#146;m sure the TL is going to be a winner, but I think it would have been dead-nuts perfect by reducing the angle of the wedge a bit. The wedge may say sport, but it does not say elegance… larger sedans have to keep it to a minimum.

Not totally happy, but I&#146;ll take either one of these cars on looks… for the most part there is harmony and order to the details and lines… no unnecessary topography. They sure do beat the Bangle bimmers."
1019,blueguydotcom,"March 4, 2004 7:19PM","I like the TL's shape. I prefer creases and hard lines and edges. I do not like large flat surfaces - like the slab sides of the G35, the CTS and the just plain ugly doors on the G35 coupe.

Torrance, Calif. 03/02/2004 -- Continuing its record-breaking streak for the fourth consecutive month, Acura posted February sales of 15,155 vehicles, shattering the previous record of 13,677 set in February 2001 and ending the month up 33.8 percent compared to last year, the division announced today. Year-to-date Acura sales rose to 28,286, up 29.4 percent compared to last year.

The TL performance luxury sedan and MDX luxury SUV both set new February records. The TL, Acura's top selling vehicle for the past five months, sold 6,274 units and beat the existing record of 5,878 set in February 2001. Compared to the same month last year, TL sales increased 57.6 percent. The popular MDX set a new February record of 4,929 units, an increase of 9.2 percent versus a year ago.

""Demand for the new TL sedan is stronger than ever,"" said Dick Colliver, executive vice president, sales. ""The all-new car is doing an excellent job of attracting new buyers to Acura.""

The hot-selling TSX sports sedan also continues to perform above forecast with sales of 1,959 units."
1030,raher,"March 5, 2004 6:30PM","'05 Acura RL - As you probably know by now, a prototype of the production '05 RL is set to be unveiled at next month's New York International Auto Show. As usual, the Temple of VTEC will be in attendance, delivering full coverage. Just recently we've heard some information from several diverse sources and the info seems to be fairly solid. Some of the stuff has already been ""confirmed"" (by logical interpretation of public statements), but some of it is new. In the first category is the drivetrain - we can say with virtually 100% certainty that it will be a V6 with AWD. The AWD system will almost certainly be based upon the Pilot/MDX's VTM system. One source (in our own forums) goes a step further and reports that the standard torque biasing will be 70/30 front to rear. Current horsepower estimates peg the car at around 300hp. We've heard a number of figures on displacement ranging from 3.4 to 3.8L, but our best guess is that it will use a 3.5L variant of the TL's motor. IMA does not seem to be a part of the equation at the time of launch. Other interesting tidbits: the RL will feature fairly extensive use of aluminum body panels: roof, hood, and trunklid. The car will also continue to build upon Acura's renewed emphasis on performance. The car is said to perform as well or better than the hot '04 TL (recall the TL 6MT's very impressive skidpad and slalom figures). Based upon our sources, it seems the car will be positioned lower than where earlier rumors had it pegged (those rumors indicated it would be a true 7-series, S-class or Lexus LS competitor). While the TL is positioned against the 5-series (yet priced like a 3-series), the RL will very likely fall somewhere in between the 5-series and 7-series in size. Pricing will probably not deviate too far from the current RL's pricing, and the content level will build upon the TL's segment-blasting features. We've heard a few reports that luxury items such as power adjusted rear seats will appear on the RL. It's our understanding that the car's audio system was not developed with ELS. I will personally be surprised if it surpasses the TL's superb ELS system. As in past Legend/RL models, the car's development was carried out almost entirely in Japan and it will be built there as well."

Maybe the same ""fools"" who are helping set sales records for FWD cars. Maybe you need to ask yourself what qualifies you to call anyone a fool based on your opinion of what constitutes a performance sedan. This board is full of posts with statistics on performance and handling of FWD, RWD and AWD and in the end there is very little actual difference in the objective facts. Most of the differences are opinions held by individuals who seem to lack respect for someone elses opinion. I drive a FWD performance sedan and I am no fool."
1033,blueguydotcom,"March 5, 2004 7:57PM","If you have AWD, then the safety reasons people opt for FWD are now null. With that safety element now gone, there's no reason for Acura to retard the car's performance with the majority of the power running through the front wheels by default.

AWD would allow Acura to finally move away from that which keeps many buyers at bay. You seem enamored with sales numbers so maybe this would appeal to you: if Acura offers a performance sedan that finally drives like a performance sedan while also offering a drive system that meets the ""safety"" needs of the FWD buyers, Acura could increase sales. Suddenly, two camps now see value where before only one group of buyers would.

I have nothing against FWD buyers. I do have a problem with a manufacturer finally taking a step toward making a performance sedan by switching to AWD but then curtailing the vehicle's performance by keeping power going through the steering wheels.

AWD properly set up on a TL would get my business and probably that of many others. FWD on the TL will not. They could have 500 HP coming out of that car and it could cut through the slalom at 90 mph. I still wouldn't buy it as my primary fun car as it just doesn't cut it for me anymore."

They do however point out whether a company is making money at what they are doing, assuming their cost elements are being met. They also show whether consumers are buying their product. From Acura's perspective, they have always built FWD cars and they have always been able to sell them. The fact that TL sales are up 57% lets Acura know they don't have to make any major changes to their manufacturing facilities by switching to RWD or AWD. Assuming their market share will increase by switching to another drivetrain is a risk they may not be willing to assume since they are already increasing sales. It will always be about making money for the major manufacturers.
Sales usually dictate changes. The RL has fallen way behind in the luxury class because it has not kept pace with the competition. The consumer has dictated that Acura make changes or get out of that market segment. Acura engineers have decided that a 70 - 30 split is what they want to do for their AWD. I guess they forgot to consult you prior to their decision but they seem to have an enviable track record making decision on their own.

As for FWD as long as it does the job, I am fine with it. It is one of the best handling(ranks 3rd) in C&D but overall it ranks first to most magazines. It is a lot better than Integra GSR.

At this point, thankfully, it's all conjecture and there is no official confirmation that the RL will have a ridiculous 70/30 split.

And Subaru's pretty much proven a 30/70 split front/rear allows the WRX Sti to marry blistering acceleration with superb cornering as oversteer can finally be induced (something that was nigh impossible with the normal WRX).

I would guarantee you that as crappy as some of the Ford or GM products are, if they made cars of Yugo quality, they wouldn't sell nearly as well.

A perfect example of this is Hyundai. When they first came out, they sold like hotcakes mainly because they were cheap. Then all sorts of problems with quality surfaced, and sales plummeted. Then Hyundai started to gradually increase the quality of its products, and sales are on the rise again.

I certainly hope Acura consults you prior to doing anything as stupid as deciding on their own what the best split is for their AWD. God forbid they would utilize their own engineering history and experience.
99.9 % of the general public buying and driving performance sedans will never drive their cars to anywhere near their limits. They will however probably drive in snow and rain and make their buying decisions based on those kinds of factors.
There are a small percentage of drivers who do enjoy driving their cars near the limit. They tend to gravitate towards sites such as these. That is not however a true reflection of the general buying public. It is why FWD cars still sell as well as they do and why AWD cars sell as well as they do.
Racers and enthusiasts choose RWD or AWD because they are going to push their cars to the limits and RWD is the best drive train for driving on the edge. I just don't believe the majority is driving close enough to the limit to really benefit. Automakers make cars for the majority because they have to stay in business. Those automakers who participate in racing use it as development and eventually pass on what they learn to their production models.
Near luxury performance sedans are not race cars. They are a little bit of luxury and a little bit of performance. Some lean more towards one than the other and we make our choices accordingly. $35K these days gives you some very nice choices and in the end I still think they are all very close in any comparison you do. I think the car I bought has excellent performance, safety, luxury and yes it has FWD.

I've read on BMW boards and actually heard from my salesperson of people who bought the 330i Performance Package and then found it was too rough for their liking. BMW didn't make that package for everyone...my brother in law (owns a 325i) thinks my car is too fast, too loud and too rough. To each his own.

I think the car I bought has excellent performance, safety, luxury and yes it has FWD.

It's important that we like what we buy. Hopefully Acura will offer something by 2006 that will get me to buy from them. I want to give Honda my money but I also want to like the car I drive. Give me a sweet honda tranny, at least 270 hp and AWD and I'll be a happy monkey.

It's not worth the risk to four wheel drift on the open road these days. It's roulette..John Law is waiting for you right around the corner.
The racetrack is the place to play.

Cops...argh. In San Diego the CHP has gone from annoying to fascist. Apparently the head Nazi in Sacramento said speeders are evil and instead of looking for real crime the cops should harass us. I've heard SD tickets have increased insane amounts over the past year. It's gone from 75 in a 65 is okay to 70 in a 65 might get you a nightstick-carrying, mustached goon breathing donuts particles on you.

Tracks...I wish. Unfortunately, when those events occur at Qualcomm I'd have to to endure BMWCCA types. I may break down one day and join up just to get access to the road courses but I don't like the idea of membership in any group with bylaws."
1048,riez,"March 6, 2004 3:01AM","Check out p. 9 of the 3/8/04 issue of AutoWeek. Their brief review of the TL A-Spec. The one they drove had an MSRP of $41,893. Excerpt:

""Almost makes me forget about the BMW 3 Series. Almost. ... Overall the TL isn't quite as smooth or as refined as the mighty 3. It is close, though, really close.""

1049,danny1878,"March 6, 2004 6:00AM","Jrock is right, there is no clear cut winner in $30k-39k car. there is always a thing or two missing in one car compare to another.

Blueguy I think you misunderstood me between quality and affordability.

G35=basic price $28,5k
ES330=basic price $32,5k
TL=basic price $33,2k
330i=basic price $35,8k
Bigmac= $3
Although very few people choose basic model if not none.

The story of sales doesnt match if it is about affordability only. According to affordability factor, people would have bought more G35 then ES330 then TL then 330i. And they could only buy the very basic model. So affordability does very little in this sales story.

Then if it is about quality, then 330i(if you think 330i is the best) should have better sales between those car.

And again like Jrock meant, there is no single factor that dominate people's mind in choosing the car. Its a combination of both.

About McDonald, I prefer Burger King. I have to do some research first before I try to comment about burger. Not my field I guess lol.

About torque steer, I choose a car based on my purposes only.
How many time you plant your foot to the pedal when taking a corner? TL's cornering is not the best but one of the best IMO.
How many time you speed your car when driving in a highway? Many times lol
How much time do you spend inside your car?
How many time do you risk your car in a race track?

Intensive marketing/advertising programs, patriotism (doesnt apply to these cars except GM, ford), fanaticism, better incentives, popularity, different market segment.

In any case, I for one am glad that the TL is FWD. I definitely feel that RWD is more fun to drive and that FWD has its limits, but some people want a sporty experience in a FWD setup (for foul weather purposes), and are not willing to pay the extra $2000 or so to get AWD, and its associated decrease in gas mileage.

It just makes more economical sense for Honda to make the TL FWD, since platform sharing with the Accord and the TSX helps keep costs down. They don't make a single RWD sedan yet. Even though Honda/Acura NA sells more cars than Nissan/Infiniti NA, Nissan is a significantly bigger company in Japan than Honda."

Let me get this straight so I understand the conversation. The Acura TL is a toy, but the Honda V6 full-loaded for $7K less, is plebian basic run-of-the-mill appliance transportation. The TSX, which is the same price as the Honda is a toy. Okay, now I got it.

I'm not sure why it's important that one believes there is a line in the sand between basic run of the mill appliance transportation and toy, but I'm trying to understand the price at which toy becomes necessity. In my mind anything more than a Hyundia Excel is a toy. It's just a matter of degree.

Then the conversation becomes, which toy is the most expensive, fun to own, most reliable, etc. So while I agree with you blueguy, nobody *needs* a car like this. It's obvious that people *want* these types of cars."

Whatever they're adding, from what i've seen it's an aero kit, some suspension/tire mods and a tweaked exhaust it's not nearly worth 10k. We're talking parts...not the value of the car. Even if the TL stickered at 25k as is and the a-spec raised the price to 35k I'd be annoyed as the parts could be added aftermarket for that price.

If it is about a car then actually for 4 months I had been researching and comparing 330i, gs300, es330, G35 and 325i (No acura in my top list) before I even knew about TL.

Choosing car is a complicated issue, you cant compare one's driving experience with the other. You cant value TL for just $25k bcuz 6k people/month would disagree while maybe only 467 people would agree to it.

And if that autoweek number is correct, that's a Navi equipped unit, correct? I think that adds up. $35K+ for the car and $5900 for the package = over $41K. So can we now stop saying things like ""$45K for a TL"", ""33% more"", ""$10K more"", etc? At least until Acura makes the numbers public or we have a more reliable source.

I see that motortrend has reported testing the A-spec and they support the $5200+install number. According to them, you get the following:

an aero kit that incorporates a front air dam, small chin spoiler, body side skirts, and a choice of two different rear spoilers--a small trunklid spoiler or a larger (yet still tasteful) rear wing. The aero kit was wind-tunnel tested and produces more downforce while generating a slightly improved overall Cd.

A-SPEC badging flanks the body panels, and the TL's well-trimmed interior is left alone save for a recontoured, slightly thicker racing-style steering wheel.

more aggressive suspension tuning

Most visible are the 18x8.5-inch alloy wheels and grippy 235/40VR18 Yokohama AVS ES100 tires.

The rest of the underpinning mods include a track-tuned shock and coil-spring combo that lowers ride height by one inch. Special attention was paid to spring rate and shock valving to ensure sportier handling without the tradeoff of a harsh on-highway ride.

and some more tidbits from their article:

In A-SPEC form, both torque steer and understeer are dramatically reduced--we even experienced an occasional hint of oversteer on aggressive corner turn-in. Braking performance from the factory-installed Brembo four-piston disc brakes improves, too, thanks to reduced nosedive during hard stops and the stickier rubber.

The A-SPEC package was not only developed under Acura's umbrella, but the added cost ($5200 plus installation) can be rolled directly into the purchase or lease price. Finally, the factory warranty remains unviolated.

and the numbers? Stock vs. A-spec
Braking, 60-0, ft 141 119
Slalom, mph 62.5 66.1
Skidpad, g 0.77 0.83

now, question, does anyone have published numbers for a non-ZHP 330 vs. a ZHP 330 and the total price difference? Now, we're not talking the Peformance Pack, right? No engine mods.

Guess that is why I bought an IS300 manual. Could get a reliable fun car for about $30,000. And it had HID and LSD.

If you are really into performance, go with the two seater. its better than buying performance package which doesnt perform (0-60 5.9), the A-spec which is mainly only stability & body makeup. Sedan always have the luxury part, with too much performance, nobody cant even see it, its too fast.:-)"

1100,chrisboth,"March 8, 2004 8:58PM","Do it yourself and dont pay someone to make mods to your car or do them one at time.

Maybe some will want the body packages and the ASPEC buyers will be there for those who just want a newer looking or cooler looking car. All the performance stuff anyone can do anywhere without much help. The funnest thing of owning a G has been minor tweaks and little money that create small incrimental gains that I can notice and tweak. Do one and then do another down the road while appreciating each tweak on its own is my philosophy. I would suggest most of us would rather buy the car without a perf pack and make the mods ourselves. The ZHP is an exception as it offers some big changes to a luxo car to get it to be alot differet.

For 200 bucks I added 10-14 Hp with an intake. For another 120 I added no real gains with my Hyper Grounding Kit but added much smoothness and better responsiveness while eliminating the gurgle the intake created. For another 450 I bought a Crawford Z car intake plenum which adds 20hp. So for less than 1k I got about 20-25 HP at peak, increased the sound quality of the motor, get better gas mileage (4-5 mpg), have a smoother idle and start up and I don't have the HP drop at 6000.

If they offered a $6000 nismo package I' say no, do the perf mods myself and save $5000 on body kit bolt ons that will never work out as well as if bolted on at the plant in the first place.

Now I belive I am running Z power at the crank anyway - weight diff is about 150#. Anyone see the Z in the lastest C&D. They got a 13.8 1/4 running stock at 102 or so. Everytime they test the FM seems faster and faster! Break in alone is good for 20hp I'd bet with the VQ."
1101,shipo,"March 8, 2004 9:42PM","I am of two minds on this one. In most cases, I would be inclined to buy the base car and then tweak it myself, most likely after the manufacturers' warranty expired. That said, between the 325i and the 330i, and again between the 330i and the 330i ZHP, one would be hard pressed to match the full package of the more expensive car for the same money, to say nothing of having a factory warranty on the extra goodies. So, in the case of the 3-Series, I'd be more inclined to go with the factory upgrade.

1104,shipo,"March 8, 2004 11:35PM","Okay, fair enough, I hadn't considered that the difference between the 330i SP and the 330i ZHP was considerably less than just the cost of the ZHP. As such, I went through and configured the three as I would have ordered them.

325i, 5-Speed, Metallic Paint, Leather, PP, SP, Harmon Kardon: $36,595
330i, 6-Speed, Metallic Paint, PP, SP, Xenon: $41,570
330i, 6-Speed, Metallic Paint, ZHP, Leather, Moon Roof, Xenon: 43,470

So, in the ""As I would buy it"" configuration, the 330i comes at a $4,975 premium. Fairly substantial, however, IMHO, the considerable power gain, coupled with the 6-Speed transmission, bigger brakes, and bigger wheels and tires easily justify the price.

Then there is the 330i to 330i ZHP difference of only $1,900, a no-brainer on a car listing at over $40K.

Things are getting complicated at Nismo, Nissan's motorsports and tuning arm. So, far, the U.S. distributor has been shipped more than 700 sets of high performance suspension, wheel, and exhaust packages for the 350Z. And ideally, the company would like to send the same sport goodies for the Infiniti G35 coupe (known as the Nissan Skyline coupe in Japan).Because, hey, this Nismo Skyline developed together with Sony's Gran Turismo people looks pretty damn good. The problem is that in the U.S. the car is an Infiniti, not a Nissan, as it is in Japan, and the U.S. marketing types feel that Nismo parts might not suit the upscale brand image."

As most of you may be aware, the April issue of Consumer Report states that U.S. made cars are more reliable than German made cars, but are not yet equal to those made by the Japanese. What do the German car lovers have to say about this? Could CR possibly be bowing to political pressure in upgrading the reliability of domestic cars to promote their sales in an effort to jump start the U.S. economy and the long slump in domestic car sales?

I don't think CR is fudging and I wouldn't be shocked if American cars are more reliable than German makes. Remember MB's reliability has slipped massively since they merged with Chrysler. VW's consistently ranked down around the Korean brands. BMW's plagued by electrical problems - all their stupid gadgets on the 5 and 7 only serve to drag down the company's reliability scores.

My bro-in-law's 745i is a fun car to drive but all that junk is bound to go wrong. He asked me if I'd want his 7 in 2006 and I laughed because the upkeep on the rolling super computer would be more expensive than just about any other car around."

Yes the CTS is a near luxury performance sedan, but the CTS-V isn't. Neither is the C32, S4 or M5. It's so easy to bring up a car that will easily beat the rest just to bang on the GM drum.

The CTS in it's basic form can't do squat with the 330i or G35, and now TL.

""Power's got 'em a lot worse than that... almost all of the Germans are now under the below
average line, some close to bottom feeders.""

Thats more of the same survey harping that seems to have infected this board, you like others believe that GM cars are all around better now because they have less problems, forget all other aspects about the vehicle....""hey they don't break down as often anymore"". Whatever.

No there is no excuse for Chrysler quality problems, but to sit there and say it's because of the Daimler side of the house is beyond ridiculous when they've had the problem for years. I supposed GM has done right by Saab too right?

Pretty surprising. Infiniti ranked number one over Lexus in the 2001 and 1999 cars category, the latter by a significant amount.

Off-topic, but also notable is Hyundai reliability improving a great deal. Wouldn't be surprised if their reliability rivals the Japanese Big 3 in a few more years.

I am not the type of person that will stay loyal to one car manufacturer. I am always open to new or improved models from different Companies. There have been various types of vehicles that have been driven by either my wife and I or my parents over the last 10yrs ( CLK430,LS400,RX300,ES300,Thunderbird,Firebird, Grand am,Audi A6,G35coupe)

Best in terms of Quality and Reliability = LS400

This car was driven hard for about 70K and there were no mechanical problems and no rattles or squeaking noises like what came with my CLK430,G35coupe
 
Another endorsement for Lexus... The RX300 has 186,000 miles with no major problems other than routine Maintenance

Lets take a look at some of the others...

89 Firebird purchased used. I had several expensive problems until I finally sold the money pit and used the proceeds for a down payment on my wife's wedding ring. I guess the wife won that battle.

94 thunderbird...What can I say other than CRAP! It died at 76K. Too many problems to list.

CLK430 had it's share of rattles and fuse shortages. It was handed in with 80K and a transmission problem. Thank God it was a lease.

G35coupe It only has 8K but the minor squeaks from different areas in the car can be annoying at times. I am very happy with the car but we just did not have these issues with any of the lexus vehicles listed above.

Audi A6.. Let me state the positive first. It handled very well in the snow. Better than any other vehicle I have driven including the RX300. Unfortunately the car is the definition of what a Lemon is. Can anyone say Fuse Out! The same fuse went out 3 times. The car also failed to start on atleast 3-4 occasions. The first happened at a funeral. What timing! The list goes on but I think my point is made...

1200,danny1878,"March 10, 2004 9:39PM","IMO I dont care who or which country that make the car, as long as it meets my requirement then its fine.

Why people keep comparing a 5.7 litre engine with ~3.0 litre engine? $50k VS $30-40k? What about the 3.6 CTS-V which is more makes sense.

There is always something that we dont like either its about the look, reliability, performance, luxury etc. For 50k I would go with Lexus/BMW and maybe the future model of RL (need to see it first thou). Its a blunt attempt to make a car with performance only without considering other aspects."

As a passionate car lover I'm speaking from a purely emotional level. I feel the same way about Steven Spielberg, Microsoft, McDonald's and a host of other franchises/companies that represent qualities I dislike.

Of course on a business school, bottom-line side I totaly understand the economic ramifications created by voiding any of these moneymakers. The ardent capitalist side screams, ""Make money any way you can. Sell them a box of rocks fro $1000 and call it Mars' Diamonds.""

The cold, business school trained analytical side tends to scare more people than the emotional side. If I could stamp out substandard products at half the cost of my competitors and lure more people into buying my products for multi billion dollar profits I would.

I would really appreciate that."
1205,shipo,"March 11, 2004 2:37AM","...regarding ""Near Luxury Performance Sedans"".

As a point of reference, I drive a 2002 530i 5-Speed with enough extra goodies to have brought the MSRP up to nearly $49,000. That said, I got a good deal and did the European Delivery thing which resulted in a final price of just south of $43,000. That of course does not count the cost of the European trip, but I would have taken it anyway (and rented a car while I was there).

From my point of view, my car completely meets my needs, wants and desires. It's fun to drive, economical (31 mpg on the highway), reliable (two years old and no unscheduled trips to the dealership), good looking inside and out, luxurious, certainly fast enough to get my attention, and capable enough to deal with it's power and ability to go fast. What do I mean by that last bit? On the autobahn during my ED trip, I was tooling along at the speed limiter (128.5 mph) when a motorcycle pulled out directly in front of me doing something like 60 mph. I performed an emergency lane change (unfortunately when he saw me in the mirror he did the same, keeping him directly in my sights), and then performed what could best be described as an anchor dropping test of the brakes. At our closest we only got within two feet of each other (him under full acceleration and me in panic stop mode) so he still had a little margin for his error and as such, he lived for another day (hopefully).

Having said all of that, I have been reading here that there are certain cars of a similar price and size with bigger (if not substantially bigger) motors that are ""superior"" vehicles for the money. Uh-huh, right. I suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines, and I suppose to their way of thinking, it is. To my way of thinking, that's the easy part, and that it's the rest of the package that makes the ""Upgraded"" car truly superior. Would a CTS-V for instance, have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation? Unknown, but I suspect that the CTS-V is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias, and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver.

Balance, that's what the BMW offers, and yes, on paper it will certainly cost more for what you seem to get. So, if I had it to do all over again, and if I was faced with the choice of a CTS-V or my 530i for about the same price, what would I choose? Probably the BMW. Call me naïve, call me dumb, call me wasteful, call me a poseur, call me whatever you like. I can live with that. ;-)

I think the numbers and actual dynamics of both cars are good but there is a consistently better performance margin from the G which would indicate ease of manuevering in same situation. And we've beat the brakes thing to death. The BMW is more forgiving and not as sport as the barely entry lux G. Doubt there much to disagree with other than preference there. Both cars on the autobahn are better than any caddy - so far...Shipo hit it on the head pretty well with the stuffing a big motor in it doesn't make it better...I was dissapointed in what i've discovered about the CTSV and would hope a 300hp 6 and a better interor was in the making."
1214,shipo,"March 11, 2004 2:06PM","Extra mass compared to what? Not trying to pick a fight, however, the manual transmission version of the 530i weighs in at only 96 pounds more than a three pedal G35 Sedan; that's not even a tank of gas. That said, the SP on my 530i includes 235 section width tires as opposed to the 215 tires that come on the G35, my guess is that the extra inch of tire width will at least offset the whopping 96 pound weight difference. Call it a draw.

Regarding my comment about another car acquitting itself as well as my car did in the situation I found myself in, you will notice that I was referring a (presumably) nose heavy CTS-V and not the G35. I consider the G a reasonably well balanced car with very acceptable driving characteristics. To my eye however, its styling inside and out just doesn't pass muster, which I understand is simply personal preference.

1215,bxd20,"March 11, 2004 7:52PM","CTS-V is 54/46 according to Road and Track. That's not nose heavy.

Since you are commenting quite a bit about your 5 series and weight, consider this comment by C&D Mar 2004 in regards to the M5 vs. CTS-V:

""Cadillac's steering was gratifyingly precise. It turned in like Marshall Faulk cutting for the goal line, and if its weight transfer wasn't quite as smoothly managed as the M5's, there wasn't a hint of reluctance in its transient responses. The CTS-V was also perfectly happy to provide the driver with as much oversteer as he wanted. The breakaway might be a little more abrupt, but once rotation set in, it was easy enough to control with a judicious throttle foot.""

As we all know, the CTS-V edged out the M5 in lap times despite the driver admittingly short-shifting due to a faulty oil pressure sensor on the CTS-V. In his best estimate, he would have beaten the M3 as well if pushing the Caddy at 100%.

1216,shipo,"March 11, 2004 8:10PM","Hmmm, 54/46 sounds nose heavy to me, maybe not FWD nose heavy but front biased nonetheless, especially when compared to the 50.1/49.9 of the 530i.

Regarding the E39 M5 that was so gracefully retired, still at the top of the heap last year; I suppose that Cadillac should in all fairness be able to crow about being ""King of the Hill"", for a while that is. Like everything else out there, the competition does not stand still. The odds on bet is that the CTS-V will once again be considered an ""Also-Ran"" in a year's time or so, just like the CTS has been since it was launched.

I do stand corrected on the mass, however. I thought it was much heavier than it really is.

As far as the CTSV being an ""also-ran"", I think it will still be held up as ""the most bang for the buck"" regardless. Its the same reason the Z06 does so well in comparisons with much more expensive cars.

Uh-huh, right. I suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines, and I suppose to their way of thinking, it is. To my way of thinking, that's the easy part, and that it's the rest of the package that makes the ""Upgraded"" car truly superior. Would a CTS-V for instance, have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation? Unknown, but I suspect that the CTS-V is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias, and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver.""

Let me setup a scenario: You go to the track to race somebody in a CTS-V, or even - say - a Pontiac GTO. After they smoke you, you get out - fuming mad - and shout: ""Well, my car has more horsepower per liter! That's all that counts. That's what makes my engine superior. They cheated! They have more displacement"".

Sound absurd to you? Well, that's what your argument amounts to. This is a miserable debate - born out of lies and advertising propaganda - that repeats itself each hour of the day all over car forums on the internet, by people who overpaid for imports (with engines that the dealers said is superior to anything made in America) and then end up getting owned by folks driving cars with ""old-tech"" OHV engines.

A couple of clowns who write for auto publications have decreed that it's better to produce additional power by revving at higher RPM's than it is by increasing displacement. Why? Because they said so. Because they have English degrees (and no science training) from 3rd rate universities to back it up. That's why. And anyone who challenges this orthodoxy is labelled a luddite.

I suppose for you old dudes, it's kind of like Vietnam. ""They lied to us man, they lied to us!!!"" =]

Now the 2004 BMW 530 isn't a bad car, but it is overpriced. And it looks like a Honda from the rear. And if you think it's any performance match for the CTS-V, then I'm afraid you smoked too much of that green stuff back in the jungles of 'Nam.

First of all, I'd like to point out that the Euros would make more high displacement engines if they could. ""There's no replacement for displacement"". In their home markets, they have moronic laws that tax based on engine displacement. That's why they shift development dollars to those high revving buzzboxes. When displacment is limited, and you're making a 6 or 8 cyllinder engine, you'll get more power out of DOHC, even though OHV has a higher power density (which I will explain in a minute).

Second, displacement tells you NOTHING about an engines actual size. Repeat after me kiddies: displacement tells you NOTHING about an engines actual size. GM's LS6, for example, is smaller than Nissan's 3.5L VQ (a V6 engine). OHV engines have more compact packaging than DOHC's. That's why the LS6 has such high power density, unmatched by anything that BMW has got.

Third, the LS6 also produces power in a more fuel efficient manner than BMW's M5 and M3 engines. It's smaller, more fuel efficient, and more powerful. I fail to see what - if any - the redeeming aspects of BMW's M engines are. And keep in mind, I'm talking about the M engines. Your 530 engine isn't even in this league.

Finally, I don't know where you got the impression that your 530 can outhandle a CTS-V. The CTS-V smoked the BMW M5 and M3 on the Nurburgring. It's fast in 0-60, and it's no slouch in 60-0 thanks to the 14 inch Brembos.

For that matter, I doubt your 530 could keep up with the plain old 3.6L 255HP CTS that sells well equipped for ~$35,000."

That's another interesting post.

Well, if the V won't cut it, what will? You get 400hp, standard everything except sunroof, and a usuable rear seat and trunk all for under $51k. Meanwhile, 6 cyl BMW 3s and MB Cs can touch $44+ without a problem. A define near luxury cars as those who's prices start around $30k and provide somewhat uplevel features and safety equipement not found or not standard on cheaper midsized cars. There are a few cars that bend the rule such as the Maxima or Avalon. They can be had stripped or equipped with almost every two in the book. A WRX or Evo are not near luxury cars by any strech of the imagination. However, hear's the real question, how can cars like the 3 series and C class be near luxury when people can barely fit in the back seat?

There is obviously a class of car...hmmm...sports sedans perhaps, that combine performance and luxury. Some tilt more to performance (IS, 3/5 series), some more to luxury (ES, G35) and some are a perfect blend of the two...my TL (ducking now as those German fans throw stuff at me).

I guess I've been thinking of ""near luxury"" as ""entry level luxury"" and the reality is they could mean two different things. If you thikn about it, the term NEAR luxury would tend to describe vehicles like the new loaded-up Accords - because of the word near as in ""close to"" - ""close to"" luxury is not entry-level luxury, and I think for the most part entry-level luxury has been the main focus here.

Should we create a price range (how about $32-$42k?) along with a certain level of amenities - leather, premium stereo, climate control, power seat adjustments, upper range of safety features, perhaps navi, available at least as options? What else? How should we quantify ""performance""? I guess that's been a big stumper here, hasn't it.

When I read near or entry-level lux I think of cars that are scraping the bottom of the luxury barrel - the 3 series, the C class, IS300, ES300, Type X. These are cars from luxury brands that are used to suck in buyers. Get them into the luxury fold with low prices and attempt to move them upmarket when they trade out in 3-5 years.

It's a luxury brand selling first the brand and then the amenities - some upmarket bits - but for the most part it's about getting buyers to associate good things with a brand. They want buyers to identify with the brand and hope the buyers are looking to graduate up.

The Accord is at the top of the Honda food chain. It tops out there so it can't possibly entry-level lux - there is no upsell at the end of the Accord tenure.

We're in the same field I think. I tend to view near/entry lux as a vehicle that doesn't have the full boat of brand cache. A 3 series, while fun, still suffers in many eyes from the fact it's a compact sedan. You own a C or a 3 and it's usually not a big deal. An e Class or a 5 series that's a car of breeding - all perception but that's what we're talking about here.

I think the cars you name are certainly some that this discussion could best serve. I understand your point, but ""scraping the bottom of the barrel"" is an image that is a little overly harsh regarding the very fine vehicles on your list.

The average mom and pop car may even cost as much as the C, IS, ES, etc but those Hondas/Toyotas don't offer the visceral pop and the brand of the similarily priced, possibly higher performing counterparts.

Remember, the C and 3, like the ML and X, are there to get people into the brand. Lexus IS was released with one goal: lower the average age of Lexus buyers. They want to hook them into the brand at 20, so at 35 the LS is a reasonable jump.

jrock, you mentioned the Phaeton. The sales of the Phaeton (304 in the USA for January and February COMBINED) would lead one to conclude the general buying public doesn't accept the idea of a luxury VW. It's the company that makes the bug and still does to this day! A 17k bug parked next to a 50k+ Phaeton? Talk about a blunder by VW."

I thought, at first, entry-level lux might be the ticket to answering the question, but then there are still some problems with that. For instance, the Acura TSX is, technically, Acura's entry level sedan, not the TL. The Volvo S40 would be the entry, not the S60. And the 1-series bimmers would be in the same boat when and if they arrive. Yet we can't logically step up to the A6 and E-class just because we include the 2nd tier from the other brands. So where does that leave us?

We could limit it to certain manufacturers, but I fear this also presents a problem. I think Subaru, for instance, may compete very well with the new Legacy if they chose to load it up with goodies. Is it fair to exclude them just because they can't afford to start up a whole new rebadged brand to accomodate their vehicles with luxo ammenities?

Maybe its a more complex answer. Like, if the brand has an upscale counterpart, then the base brand is excluded. So Audi, but no VW; Acura, but no Honda; Infinity, but no Nissan; etc. However, if said brand has no upscale counterpart (i.e., Subaru, Saab, MB, BMW, Volvo, etc.), then it can be considered on its own merits. Of course, that still leaves us with the problem of someone complaining the STi should be included although it doesn't even offer a stereo. So we still need to figure what is required at a minimum to make it a car with luxo aspirations. Maybe available navigation and power leather seats? Can anyone think of something that falls outside those requirements that would be included or excluded here unfairly?"

If you can afford a hand-built luxury car but don't need to go around with a three-pointed star or a leaping cat or a flying lady hood ornament to proclaim your arrival, then you may find that this new $64,600 VW more than meets your needs.

We use the word ""more"" because the Phaeton offers a luxury car with a 12-cylinder engine for about the price of a V8-powered Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Phaeton comes standard with features such as a navigation system for about what you'd pay for a basic short-wheelbase 7 Series BMW.

Volkswagen is moving upscale and the Phaeton is its new luxury sedan, the flagship of a fleet that in the North American market includes the Golf, New Beetle, Jetta, Eurovan, Passat, and the new Touareg sport-utility. In 2006 we should see a modern interpretation of the hippies' favorite, the VW Microbus, followed, perhaps, by a new, mid-engine, two-seat sports car. The expansion of the Volkswagen brand is part of an effort to widen the scope of the entire VW Group, an automotive empire that includes VW, Audi, SEAT, Skoda, Lamborghini, Bugatti and Bentley. In 1999, the Volkswagen Group ranked sixth in worldwide sales, but subsequently has overtaken Renault/Nissan and DaimlerChrysler and trails only General Motors, Ford and Toyota.

These cars didn't differ much from their platform-mates and were lacking many of the luxury features of the ""true"" luxury cars.

It seems to me like the term may be a bit more problematic now. Yes, the ES330 is still built on the Camry platform and the I35 is still based on the Maxima. However, they look a lot different than the base cars now, and have quite a few more luxury features than before.

In addition, the lower-end luxury models are now featuring extremely nice interiors, many luxury features, etc. Even though my '04 TL is considered near-luxury, the interior still feels every bit as nice to me as my old '93 BMW 525i did, if not more so.

Lets nail down the logic. We've got a company well known for mechanical and electrical problems offering a high priced luxo-cruiser under the same banner as 16k economy cars and the new car most closely resembles a 23-40k mid-size sedan. That's just brilliant.

For example, Riez stated that he thinks the IS300 is higher on the food chain than the 325i, probably because it has a larger, more powerful engine (and he owns a couple of them).

I however, consider the 325i higher on the food chain than the IS300 because it's just as quick, but more refined and mature, in my opinion.

Price doesn't work either because of my admittedly biased opinion that the TSX belongs in the same league as the 325i and IS300 because it offers similar performance and luxury, but only costs $26,000.

And then there's the Mazda 6s and V-6 Accord, which offer performance and luxury on par with many of the cars here, yet they simply lack breeding (brand identification).

For a car to be a true ""near-luxury"" performance sedan, I believe it must possess some combination of all of these traits, in varying degrees.

1349,jrock65,"March 18, 2004 7:06PM","Since we're still on the subject, I wouldn't agree with that. First, it's harder to define ""luxury"" in terms of brand rather the a specific car. For example, the Q45 has more luxury than every Lexus sedan except the LS430. And I'm not sure how Infiniti and Subaru belong in the same category, even if we are talking about brands as a whole. Subaru makes 20k to 30k cars. Infiniti makes 30k to 60k cars.

This is how I would rank in terms of cachet/prestige/name recognition:

1) MB, BMW, Jaguar, Lexus
2) Audi, Cadillac
3) Acura, Infiniti, Lincoln, Saab, Volvo
4) Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Subaru, etc."

Now if you think by merely having real wood on the 3series making it more luxurious than the Maxima, then I rest my case....it's an individual thing.

Maybe we should compare cars based on their own merits and not on their perceived images; read brand names."
1351,blueguydotcom,"March 18, 2004 7:24PM","Do not agree. It's the placement of the vehicle on a luxury brand's scale that determines if it's a near/entry level lux.

The 3, C, A4, IS300 are all near/entry. They're not luxury cars though. They're the feeders to fill coffers and get brand loyalty. These cars exist at the bottom of a luxury brand's offerings.

No way in hades is Subaru near anything luxury. Subaru makes economy and joe blow cars. If you sell a car for under 20k there's no way any vehicle from the brand can be considered luxury. It goes against the concept of luxury branding.

As I've stated before, Kmart brand can sell a coat for $5k but in the end it's still a Kmart brand coat.

A Nissan Max loaded to the gills is still from the same brand as the Sentra and Frontier. It may be the most expensive car in that brand but the brand itself is common place.

An entry-level lux car is the bottom rung of the luxury brand's offerings. If the brand sells anything approaching economy cars it most certainly can not be a lux brand or offer anything that can be termed entry-level lux. Why is this a tough concept for people?"
1352,buddhabman,"March 18, 2004 7:37PM","Infiniti is a brand that has shot up these last two years. Howver prior to that it wasn't very highly considered, particularly in view of its' rebadged vehicles.

Let me admit I am a big Subaru fan. Subaru's are fairly highly regarded, if they weren't why do you see all the AWD and Sportwagons out these days. I will agree that adding it to the Premium segment is touchy, but thats only because of the prior level of interior refinement and powertrain options. The chassis/platforms and worldwide engine drivetrains are considered top notch. The US is finally geting the nicer equipment, plus nicer vehicles are in the works. All the brands seem to be getting into the entry level market, so no problem with Suabru having entry level cars."

I still think that significant noise(say, low seventies cruising)/shock supression, top-tier safety, amenities such as climate control,leather, heated seats, and respectable power ( say, 0-60 in <8 seconds ) are really requirements for luxury."

1. You run the risk of terminating your warranty as the dealer can rightly claim increasing hp/torque with unauthorized mods put undue stree on the engine/driveline components that cause the failure.

2. I do not believe these same mods contribute to an overall increase in gas mileage.

1. If brand is the main qualifier then we couldnt include Phaeton eventho Phaeton is a bit more than just near luxo (bcuz most of its product is non premium vehicle).
We have to include all lexus sedans eventho some of them doesnt have 'performance'.

2. If characteristic is the main qualifier then all sedan which qualify as premium/near luxo perf. have to be included too (such as VW Phaeton but not ES330). But then we have to define the term of luxury(unfortunately how hard the car tries to be luxurious, it's brand name tells people otherwise) and maybe we have to define the term of performance too.

3. If price is the main qualifier then STI have to be included if we include G35 based on its stripper price tag. It certainly would include ES330 but not CTS-V. And maybe we have to define what price range that could be considered as the 'premium'

Some people might/-not consider these sedans as premium/near luxury performance sedans: ES330, 1 series, 325i, TSX, Phaeton, CTS-V, new Accord, Subaru STI bcuz of various reasons. Underpower, price such as over 40k or less than 30k, regular brand name, no luxury features/ no radio.

330, TL, G35, C320, CTS and IS(would not include IS for luck of power, but it handles grate)

1368,pat,"March 18, 2004 11:54PM","It makes no sense to have a discussion completely consumed with what the belongs in the discussion and what does not.

I think that the suggestion that the entry-level lux category is the lowest sedan offering of a brand that is *generally* accepted as presenting the intent of a ""luxury"" appeal is a good one. I think two good additions to that thought are that the sedan shouldn't exceed the $40-42k'ish range in a common configuration, and that maybe we'll include the 2nd bottom vehicle in some cases (TSX and TL, S40 and S60/S60R).

So I'm exercising my, um, royal power :-), and declaring that this discussion is about the following vehicles:

Acura TSX and TL
Audi A4
BMW 3-Series
Cadillac CTS
Infiniti G35 and maybe I35
Jaguar X-Type
Lexus IS 300 and maybe ES 330
Mercedes-Benz C-Class
Volvo S60/S60R and maybe S40

I'm not adding Volkswagen for a couple of reasons. Generally speaking, one does not (at least so far) think of that brand when thinking of lux vehicles. There is the Phaeton, but in no way is it in an ""entry level"" class. So the way I see it, it doesn't belong here either way.

I'm changing the name to Entry-Level Luxury Performance Sedans from Near Luxury Performance Sedans if for no other reason than to make ME feel better about the name! But I'm leaving the ""performance"" part, so feel free to not discuss the ""maybe"" vehicles if you think they don't belong.

If anyone feels strongly that I have overlooked something important, speak up within the next day or so, or forever hold your peace!

I agree with jrock65 that Saabs are perceived as being more upscale than the Nissans, Toyotas, Hondas etc., more or less in the same bracket as Volvos.

There is some truth to every perspective on the issue of what cars belong in this discussion. Cars use combination brands -- the make and the individual model name -- to, perhaps, benefit from both family branding and individual branding. So, while there is some halo effect from the make, the dominant perception is one based on the individual model. People may swear by the ""Pathfinder"" while detesting the ""Xterra"", for example. A person driving around in a ""Land Cruiser"" is looked upon very differently than one tooling around in a ""Corolla."" So, in my view, it is more meaningful to discuss specific models as being in the upscale performance sedan category. In some (hopefully, rare) cases, therefore, cars from so-called ""lesser"" makes may deserve to be discussed in this forum as well.

There are as many ""best buys"" as there are people. It is, after all, a function of priorities driven by individual and/or family needs and wants. Every car is a compromise among competing demands, just as every purchase decision is. A lot of the firepower in these forums, while highly entertaining, is often misdirected. A lot of the criticism of different cars (and, occasionally, their owners!) is analogous to faulting the lion for not having the grace of a gazelle!:)

I am ruling out all other suggestions, though, for the reasons stated earlier. Those reasons include the fact that we should keep this to a marque that intends to convey luxury across its spectrum, it is nonsensical to have a never-ending discussion about what the discussion is about and most importantly, it's time to draw the line.

So here it is - talk about the cars in my list or go make another discussion if you need to talk about something else. Just keep in mind that another vague, undefined category doesn't serve any purpose. To keep it useful, interesting and productive, be sure to clearly define the topic.

Right now, fourteen BMW 3-series drivers are wondering how they got whooped by a FWD, 4 banger."
1397,raher,"March 20, 2004 1:42AM","Ooh boy those RWD only folks have got a task on their hands coming up with an explanation as to how this could have happened. I guess the guy driving the TSX didn't know he didn't stand a chance because of torque steer and knowing in advance those RWD guys had ""perfect balance"".blah blah blah
Once again that old addage turns out to be true..when the green flag drops, the BS stops!"
1398,kdshapiro,"March 20, 2004 2:12AM","Between the TL and 3series. It depends on your priorities. If I wanted seat of the pants M3, for 3 series prices, it would be ZHP at the top of the list. If I cared not about the precision feel of a BMW and slickness of the looks and just needed a car.. I will admit if those were the only 14 cars in the universe, it would be the Acura TL."
1399,qbrozen,"March 20, 2004 3:56AM","i haven't driven one yet, but by all accounts and specs thus far, I'd have to say the new S40 T5 6-speed is going to be high up on this list for me. Certainly much higher than number 11 (looking at buddha's list)."
1400,pg48477,"March 20, 2004 4:35AM","S60R would probably outperform any car on the list, but it's a bit expensive. I would consider 330 but new model should come out soon. If only TL would come in AWD. I think TL with A-spec would handle as well as 330 performance package, but 5k+installation is to much."
1401,cybersol,"March 20, 2004 11:16AM","I find it quite amusing that for 5 pages or so the discussion focused on what the discussion was about. Reminds me so much of meetings meant to talk about other meetings.

I think Pat's list is a good one. One addition in both my opinion and from magazines that compare vehicle in this class would be the Lincoln LS. First of all, Lincoln is obviously meant to be Ford's luxury brand. Secondly, the LS costs between 30-42k in most configurations. Third the car itself definitely has both luxury and performance intentions. By all owner accounts, it performs and handles well, even if I personally would not be interested in a Ford product at this time, so that I have not driven one.

Back to talking about cars... If I were shopping today, taking into account that my priorities are size, performance, price, reliability, and then luxury... these SEDANS would be on my shopping list in this order:

1) Infiniti G35
2) Acura TL
3) BMW 330i
4) everything else

Enjoy, cybersol"
1402,qbrozen,"March 20, 2004 7:09PM","I said it before, and I'll say it again, i really think this needs to be added.

according to C&D, 0-60 in 6.5 and:
In most track trials, the Lincoln set stellar marks. Although it was wearing all-weather tires, usually thought to be a disadvantage, it outran all but the Benz on the skidpad and topped all in the lane-change test. Very shrewd choices were made in the chassis tuning of this car.

And since the Sport V8 comes in at $40,500 with delivery, the only fault I see with it is the lack of a manual tranny. But I don't see that as a reason to exclude it because some folks prefer an auto and some even require it."
1403,pg48477,"March 20, 2004 7:21PM","LS is no near luxury, if anything it would compete with 5 series GS, RL and E class."
1404,kdshapiro,"March 20, 2004 7:27PM","""LS is no near luxury, if anything it would compete with 5 series GS, RL and E class.""

Not even close to these. IMO of course. Yes if you measure rear legroom, but all of the above vehicles are a cut above the LS in terms of amenities. The LS has no more luxury than a Mountaineer."
1405,pg48477,"March 20, 2004 7:48PM","You right, I was also referring to size. LS is a to big to be considered near luxury, and not enof luxury and quality to go up to E-class."

But, regardless, i've grown tired of getting disciplined by the principal. so have at it."
1408,scott1,"March 21, 2004 5:05AM","I went through all of the comparisons of the cars on this list in January while I was trying to decide which car to order. I ended up ordering a CTS with the luxury/sport package and the dvd navigation system. (blue chip exterior, light gray/ebony interior).

I drove the BMW 3 series and liked its driving characteristics, but didn't care for its styling or interior room. The same can be said for the Mercedes C class..I drove a V6 version and while it was a solid quiet riding car, it didn't have the interior space I was looking for.

I very seriously considered the Lexus ES 330, but ultimately decided that while it rode very smooth and quietly, the handling just wasn't there. The fact that it basically looked like a Camry didn't help either.

  I had a bad prior ownership experience with a Honda, so did not consider the acura.

  The CTS seemed to have exactly what I was looking for. A quiet comfortable ride combined with excellent handling, plenty of interior space in both the back and front seats, and a very refined smooth and powerful engine. The real bonus for me is the styling of the exterior though...the CTS is one fine looking car from any angle, and doesn't look like just another box on wheels.

I checked with my dealer today and he expects my car to be delivered within the next week or so. I'm looking forward to that."

1410,fedlawman,"March 22, 2004 1:14AM","Took my TSX to a BMWCCA track event yesterday at Pacific Raceways. Perfect weather, beautiful cars, and a terrific experience.

My FWD 4-banger kept up just fine with all those E46 325's. I lapped more than a few inexperienced drivers piloting E46 330's, and even paced a well driven E36 M3 for one complete lap...what a blast! Then I got a 4 lap ride in a '96 Porsche 911 Turbo. Wow!

What else...two 350Z's were out on the track - they sound awesome (nice throaty exhaust) accelerating down the straight-away and through turn 1. Also, one guy had a late model Lotus Esprit, and there were two WRX STi's out there. One of the STi's was in my group and got behind me, seemingly out of nowhere. I waved him past me after exiting turn 9 and he passed me like I was standing still (I was doing about 60)!

Overall, a terrific club and an awesome day of fun at Pacific Raceways!"
1411,kahunah,"March 22, 2004 3:09AM","Last week on the highway, this guy in a WRX STi drove up behind me and was riding my bumper...for a short time. Fed up with his arrogant behavior, I dropped my '04 TL's stick from 5th to 3rd, hit the gas, and left him in the dust, and I didn't even have to floor it. He finally caught up to me, so I did it to him again (6th to 4th). He never did pass me and I'm sure I ruined his day. I won't say how fast I was going but the TL surprised even me."
1412,blueguydotcom,"March 22, 2004 3:20AM","two options here:

1. The driver wasn't playing like you were.
2. The guy didn't know how to use turbos. Your V6 with 238lb-ft of torque on a 3400 lb car really isn't a match for a person who knows how to use the sweet spot of their turbos on a car that sports 300 lbs-ft at 4000 rpm and the car weighs 200 lbs less. In fact, it's a one sided affair."
1413,fedlawman,"March 22, 2004 3:59AM","I finally had a chance to watch the race this afternoon (I taped it earlier this morning).

It was a very exciting race, and also great to see a brand new car with little development time (TSX) do so well against the established benchmark (325i).

It was also interesting to note how evenly matched all of the cars in this competition are, even though there is a combination of FWD and RWD, and ""luxury"" (BMW 325i) vs. ""economy"" (Nissan Sentra).

Which begs the question - if RWD vs. FWD doesn't matter at Sebring, why do so many ""enthusiasts"" think it makes a difference on I-90?"
1414,jmess,"March 22, 2004 4:09AM","3. Could be another iteration of the old rope a dope game. Let some dope charge ahead and get nailed by the cop before you get there. Pretty easy to play, just find somebody with a new car and act arrogant, then see if they reciprocate.

Could it be that the WRX is overrated and the TL, underrated? ""

How does one measure the hp at the crank? IS there a special dyno for this is or did the TL owner do some funky math to get from the wheels to the crank? My guess is the math involved to make the 282 leap is rather fuzzy at best. The TL is one great value if you can stomach the wheel jerking from your hand once in a while but it is not STI beater.

If the STI was between 4500 and 7000 the whole time you would have seen nothing but fumes. The power band of the TL is quite evident in the 50-120 stats and 0-100.. I suggest you take a look at the STI stats for those metrics before you get too enthusiastic about the less than torque ridden 3.2.

""Which begs the question - if RWD vs. FWD doesn't matter at Sebring, why do so many ""enthusiasts"" think it makes a difference on I-90? ""

This explains much - I suggest anyone questioning RWD in context of freeway driving actually drive a decent RWD car on some back roads. IF someone thinks they are going to enjoy - let alone accept the seemingly foreign concept of throttle induced overteer on the highway, I imagine they will be out of the genepool soon enough.

The oversteer I paid 35k for is never enjoyed on a highway - it's enjoyed on the hairpins of an open field with a two lane country road with 10 foot tall cows and fog smoked expanses and no one in sight....and carefully pressing the throttle just enough, with just enough feedback to push the weight back to the rear wheels just as that very power causes them, with buttery smooth finesse, to slide into the perfect exit angle AND keep traction where wide open throttle can push your back into the leather.

Unless you've actually experienced this you will keep wondering!"
1419,dhanley,"March 22, 2004 3:21PM","This was gone over several times--SCCA adds balast to cars to make them competitive, and each brand has a minimum weight. It's designed so as to make the drive the issue, not the vehicle.

That being said, i would look at a FWD car next ( i like the new 9-3 ), since i'm willing to sacrifice soem handling for other attributes, but i wouldn't feel the need to fool myself into thinking that wasn't doing so.

BMW 1-Series Stuck?

One thing's for sure: BMW is not planning on bringing its 1-Series to the U.S. anytime soon. Reports published in recent days by Detroit trade papers say that the company will either kill the U.S. 1-Series project or delay it significantly based on comments made by Tom Purves, CEO of BMW North America. Purves reportedly says that the case for bringing the smallest of BMW-badged vehicles to America is still being made and the company is deciding currently which iteration(s) - coupe, hatch, or convertible - it would bring here. He also reportedly says that the company's in-line four engines would not gel with the widely-held BMW performance image in the United States, so a 1-Series powered by an in-line six is likely, if the vehicle ever shows up here. -Jack Gilbert"

I stand by my first two options and concur the third option may have been he wanted you to be the point man. I do it all the time. Let someone lead the charge by a good 1/5-1/4 of a mile and I'll keep my eyes peeled for anyone blasting onto the freeway with lights blazing.

The TL's a fantastic car. I attended a preview showing the other day for an upcoming Audi and among the other vehicles were the S60, E class, TL and 530i. I'd pick the TL over all of them and twice on Sunday. In fact I did continue to choose the TL even once they'd raised the price to 40k.

1433,dhanley,"March 22, 2004 9:39PM","I drove one at the GM autoshow-on-the-road. They had a loopy test track, and a lot of cars to take out on it.

The c320 really handled better than i expected and was very refined. It had a bit more non-melodious engine noise than i expected; i was surprised by that. It was nice, but it was also a 45K car.

The CTS was there too. It was nice, but a bit too isolated for me. I like quiet, but i want to feel the road and hear the engine rev. Somehow, the interior just seemed to whisper chevrolet. It seemed spacious inside, which probably appeals to other more than it does to me. But if you like the interior and isolation, this is probably a really good car.

Drove the 9-5 aero, that was probably my favorite, i really like the looks, interior, the actual out the door price ( they have $6000 in rebates on it now and sell at invoice(??) ) and i love the engine. But it didn't handle as well as the cts or the c320.

The 9-3 was there but it was the base 9-3 linear and didn't impress, mostly due to the interior. The engine needed more power, but the handling was really quite good. it tracked well and had good feedback. I recently sat in a 9-3 convertable at the autoshow later and thought that the interior in it was really nice, so maybe it's improved.

Also saw the s40 at the autoshow, and the interior really looked cheap to me, and there were several broken parts inside, which i guess could have been due to it's being a prototype and suffering autoshow abuse. But based on the numbers this is a really good car, so i would look at it again.

I drove an x-type 3.0. The car looks really good, i thought, and the interior is very attractive, but again there were 3 demos at the dealer and 2 had broken parts inside ( one had the cell phone cover broken by the dealership owner ). All the driving controls felt too light to me, and the engine despite its increased HP felt weak at low RPM's--i didn't feel that i could pass on the highway without dropping out of fifth, but i thought it sounded great when i revved it up. I didn't feel that i got a lot of steering feedback but it was also impressively quiet on the highway. The door sill was really high and the back doors only opened 45 degrees so it was hard for me to get in the back.

I drove a new 325i and it's good, but i couldn't help but feel that it's been somewhat lexiified. The shifter had vaguer detents and the engine noise and steering effort were dialed down. I might have liked it a lot more if it had the sport package. I don't like the newer bmw designs, and i look askance at the increasing complexity of these cars.

I drove a g35, too, it certainly had a lot of power, and had pretty good feedback. I was mostly turned off by the interior which i felt was pretty cheap and the amount of tire noise that got into the interior ( too much for my tastes ). Also, my friend who has one reports really poor MPG.

Oh, test drove the is300 as well. I thought it looked ( WARNING: personal taste issue ) tacky inside, and was too consistently noisy due to road noise. Also, the interior didn't fit my frame very well. I thought several cars felt better handling around town.

Drove a last-gen a4 1.8T. Overall thought it felt very composed and had a nice interior, but it definitely needed more engine. Also, a friend with a passat has had a dismal reliability experience. But if i was leasing it from a subservient dealer i would probably feel ok about it.

The sporty acuras i've been in (cl-s, integra,RSX) i've had a hard time getting comfortable in, so i haven't even bothered to test drive them. I haven't looked at the new tl-s.

There was nothing that made me feel that i need to go out and trade my 328i, but i want to test a 9-3 arc if i happen to be near a dealer with some free time. I almost hope i hate it so i don't feel the urge to waste money on a car swap.

1434,buddhabman,"March 22, 2004 10:24PM","Sounds like the C320 drives pretty nice, albeit $$$$$ That's great that you have had the chance for so many drives.

I have an Aero wagon, and as much as I like the car, it does need some stiffer springs and stiffer rear sway bar to help the handles. It tracks well but rough stuff in the canyons makes it hit the bump stops and there is more roll. Great brakes, and isn't it fast, 0-60 is alright but I tell you people 60-120 in an Aero is something else. I wish they would bump up the power in the 9-5 Aero. All the Saab tuners have EMP's to take it to 280-300HP.

I think the 9-3 Aero is a sweet looking car. If they bumped it to 250/250 it would be killer."
1435,dhanley,"March 23, 2004 12:10AM","Agree. The c320 was nice but seemed expensive to me for what it was--solid, quiet, ok handling but not really extraordinary, while having no glaring flaws.

I guess i didn't realize the price of the CTS i drove. I want to the caddy website and i see that was probably a $43K car ( 3.6L, xenons, upgraded sterio, sunroof ). But i suppose there will be many thousands off at some point.

The 9-5 was as you describe--swayed more than i liked, and understeer was very easy to provoke; I didn't feel secure pushing it in turns. It's acceleration was so-so 0-30 then after that, really impressive. To be blunt, i thought it was a very well-thought out car suffering from an old chassis; it could have used more suspension travel and structural ridgidity.

I expect the 9-3 areo will be 250hp beofre long, the upcoming 9-3 hatch is supposed to get 250hp out of the same motor with direct injection. You can already get a chip for that HP level, but i shy away from mods and prefer to get the power stock."

I'm only 5'11 but because of my build and how i sit a lot of cars don't have enough headroom for me. Even the cl-s puts me into a posture i don't care to maintain. My gripe with many modern seats is they seem either designed for the widening american population, or a person with narrow shoulders.

On the track or on the street, neither one is a good thing. The ideal car is neutral handling all the way to the limit.

Yes, it may be fun to play with throttle induced oversteer, and perhaps drift your car through a corner, but if you're doing this on public roads, I hope you've driven the road 1000 times, walked it right before you drive to check for new hazards such as gravel, potholes, debris, etc. that weren't there before, and block off the road at both ends to prevent another car from coming around a corner from the other direction while your coming off an apex and tracking out.

Your fantasy is nice and I'm sure you enjoy occasionally inducing the back end of your G to ""get a little loose"" and rotate towards some imagined apex (who doesn't?), but that's hardly a defining RWD ""sport sedan"" moment. I can (and do) enjoy the same effect in my FWD Honda.

ummm i do this 2x a week at least on exit and entrance ramps i can see 360 degrees around. I keep the car loose for about 7-8 seconds all the way around balancing the oversteer and understeer to find the edge of traction - this helps me undertand the limits of the car and how the car reacts to all kinds of inputs. A little spin out (which really wont happen with VDC on) is gonna cause me no problems other than some grass in my springs.

Yu dont have to induce oversteer to get what bluguy describes..the shove. It is something that DOES define the sports sedan's I want to drive - in fact it defines it in such a way that I will never pay more than 20k for a FWD car - more like 18 really.

As far as oversteer you realize that even without pushing the traction limit your car will slide if RWD in a turn..not much but when the front wheels are turning one way and the other wheels are driving a differnt angle - somthing gives and i assure you it's the rear wheels as they align themselves to the direction of travel to the front...there's just something about the balance you feel as the weight transfers and you propel (shove) down the straight road puit of a turn.

As long as you can cary enough exit speed to win the race between corners and have the brakes to stay there, you can make it really hard for somebody to pass you cleanly. Track configuration can also favor one car over another.

To really make a FWD race car work you have to have some lift throttle oversteer. We used to trail brake and run more air pressure in the rear tires to get more oversteer. Once you get back on the gas the car pushes hard. So you take an earlier apex than a RWD car, induce some oversteer via lift throttle and/or trail braking, then stand on the gas and let the car understeer out from the apex of the corner.

""Hot X-Type R seen testing
 
The long awaited X-Type R model, due late 2004 or early 2005ish, has been seen cruising the West Midlands of England during final testing. The four-wheel drive R will have the latest version of Jaguar's V6 engine, using some form of forced induction to give it 330 bhp and 330 lb. ft of torque. There has been some whispers that the engine might not follow the usual supercharged R formula, for it could well be turbocharged instead, due to a lack of space under the compact saloons bonnet. The 3.0-litre engine could also be expanded to 3.2 litres and 250bhp, an upgrade likely to debut in the whole X-Type range.
 
0-60 acceleration is said to be around the five-second mark, and top speed nudging 165 mph. Jaguar's new six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission will be standard, though no news on a Tiptronic/SMG style box - Jaguar preferring the J-Gate. The R will stand out with it's enlarged bumpers, huge exhaust pipes, mesh front grille, de-chromed exterior and 19-inch alloy wheels, but no silly body kit or boot spoilers. Unlike the other R's, it will not have any additional air intakes on its bonnet. Internally the car will remain the same as the other models, save for material/wood differences, until the whole car gets a face lift in 2006."""

This is making me weary - don't take it from me - take it from thousands of publications and books such as solo racing instuctional manuals or guides that the PERFECT turn in a RWD car involves slight and intended rear wheel slide (just a touch now - its not a burnout smokeout like some who have never driven a RWD hard suggest).

The point at which your front wheels have pushed the car to another angle while the rear wheels are driven with throttle input to the former angle there will and is a correction at higher speed. That induced oversteer which is limited to exactly the right amount becasue the weight transfers to the rear (where the driven wheels are) and traction is regained (this takes timing).

Anyone who drives a FWD and preaches that this beautiful method of driving is like teen fun in a parking lot should get a refund and drive a bike. I have suggested that on the track a FWD can have it's place and setups and drivers can compensate for anything with non-street suspsensions. Who gives a crud about the track this is about what my family sedan can do in a turn that some never may understand. I could care less whose faster I dont even race or go to the track. I want tourque and throttle induced oversteer corrections in the most perfectly balanced car maybe ever made.

HERE IS THE CRUX OF YOUR ARGUMENT: TRACTION LOSS IS BAD.

wrong - heres why

RWDers understand that this correction is intended because the momentum loss in the turn is WAY LESS if the rear wheels simply slide a bit as opposed to entering the turn at a lower speed and not having any traction lost. When this slide is complete the car actually gets the traction started again from the throttle pushing the weight back in a perfectly balanced and timed and HEAVENLY turn without ANY momentum lost.

It's like a airforce guy telling a navy skipper how to drive a ship. This very argument contains the reasons why IMO its worth all the money i put into the G every month. If there were only FWD cars I would buy a duplex or something."
1477,riez,"March 25, 2004 1:32PM","danny1878... In comparison to more powerful cars like the TL, Maxima, Seville, etc., the 4-cyl. TSX lacks the power to generate a ton of torque steer. But there still is some.

pg48477... Do your own test. Take a powerful front driver out for a spin. Make a couple of quick standing starts. Akin to 0-60 mph test. First, take your hands OFF the steering wheel. The accelerate hard. See where the car goes. Watch what is happening to the steering wheel. Next do it with your hands very lightly on the wheel. Finally with your hands very firmly on the wheel. The tugging of the steering wheel indicates torque steer by the wheels which do double duty in regards to both steering and powering at same time.

Most pronounced in cars with more power-delivery efficient manual transmissions. ATs ""sap"" some power to the wheels.

One of the best practical articles on this subject is C&D's comparison a few years ago of the RWD 330Ci to the FWD CL Type-S 6-speed manual. Their CL had the then new LSD which made a huge world of improvement.

Well designed powerful FWDer will use LSD and equal length half shafts to minimize torque steer."

What I'm trying to tell you is that this effect is not exclusive to RWD platforms. Although a well balanced FWD car can be made to ""oversteer"" with lift-throttle, you can also ""rotate"" the rear end of a FWD car with a gentle application of power. To see (feel) this in action, run a FWD car through a slalom course. When you gently press the gas and feel the rear end ""tuck in"" and rotate around the cone, you'll know what I'm talking about.

It's different than a RWD'er, and not exactly the same as ""riding the threshold"" like your talking about, but it is no less entertaining or effective.

I've had 5 honda acura products that i put to death (most were well worn when i got em) over 10 years. I know all about oversteer in a front driver. I've spent more time in front than rear wheel in fact. I'm quite satisfied with what i have now as we all seem to be. It's not about challenging or entertaining it's about knowing both types of platforms and prefering one over the other. I would think an RSX is very tossable and way fun. But to drive it would mean giving up something that is way too important to most serious Sports sedan drivers regardless of our intentions to race or win something..its about physics and working with forces as opposed to against them as FWD put the steering and drivepower at odds.

After 10 years of CRX's and integras and passats that were quite fun to drive, I can't tell you how nice it is to finally (again) not have to drive into a corner concerned that my front wheels wont be able to turn if pushed. With VDC this may not be a problem but for me the whole issue is the inherint limitations that dont exist in RWD.

""What I'm trying to tell you is that this effect is not exclusive to RWD platforms""

What is exclusive is the momentum one can have going in and out and the line you use and the way in which one can be certain that a bit of gas before the exit is good for traction in RWD and BAD for FWD. The throttle app to GAIN traction right as you exit is the money and cant be enjoyed in front drives. Otherwise we'd all be in friont drives - they are cheaper to build."
1488,chrisboth,"March 25, 2004 6:28PM","""The only ""perfectly balanced"" car is the one that's parked. ""

You actually hit on something the G designers had in mind when they decided on the ultimate distribution. The g is a 52F 48R such that when you hit the throttle in the sweet spot of the apex (the entire thrust of this whole argument) the weight shift back to a perfect 50/50. When a FWD car pushed the gas all the weight goes away from the drive wheels. RSX can still be fun, but these finely tweaked and enjoyable RWD cars are built for getting around curves a particular way..the same way as ferrari, porsche, bmw, chrysler, dodge, ford, lambo. Some may be more than i can pay but the infiniti designers spent alot of money to make sure we can do this. Noone should buy a RWD if they dont want this. If they do they dont have to risk anything to enjoy it. I have 19k on my original brakes - maybe I need to spend more time enjoying the perfection."

You likely don't personally experience any torque steer due to the lack of power, esp. little torque. Would it even have 170 wheel HP? How much torque and HP does its small motor produce at 3K, 3.5K, and 4K RPMs? Even pretty brutal high RPM 0-60 mph launch can't get too much power to the front wheels. That is where it counts! You can't expect a small 4-cyl. engine that needs to rev high for best output to compare with the output of the much bigger engines in powerful FWDers like TL, Maxima, Seville, etc.

Wonder what the power to weight ratios are for your TSX and the Neon SRT-4. (Read reports that dyno shows the Dodge engine is being underrated by DC.)"

Every car in this class is capable of above average acceleration and handling, and possesses poise, balance, elegance, and luxury that trumps the average commuter car.

Sure a Honda Accord V-6 can outrun an Audi A4 in a straight line. However, the Accord does not handle as well, look as good, offer certain luxury features, and it isn't as exclusive.

But the ""total package"" is the whole nine yards. It includes:

-price
-equipment
-basic platform
-acceleration, handling, braking, steering
-reliability/quality
-warranty
-ownership costs
-safety
-depreciation/resale value
-functionality/practicality/utility
-sales/service experience

It is as a total package that the IS300 shines. Great price. Great standard (HID) and optional equipment (LSD). Great platform, including RWD, IRS, and manual transmission. Great overall performance. Fantastic reliability/quality. Great warranty (both b-to-b and powertrain with optional mfr extension to b-to-b). Good ownership costs (though insurance a bit too high). Great safety, including crash test results. Decent depreciation. Good practicality, if a bit smallish. One of the best sales/service experiences in the industry.

It is the little things that can make the big difference. Can you get LSD? Mine does. Does your manufacturer sell its own extended b-to-b warranty? Mine does, out to 7yr/100k."

My TSX has 99% of the performance of the IS300, yet has a much nicer and higher quality interior (IMO), a smoother quieter ride on the highway (IMO), and a more dynamic and exciting engine/transmission combo (IMO).

1518,raher,"March 27, 2004 5:56PM","Sales figures reflect how any automobile is being received by the consumer. In the long run they determine whether any model continues in production based on the manufacturer's defined return on investment. Sales determine whether a manufacturer makes changes to an existing model to improve sales or whether they decide to introduce a new model.
Sales figures certainly do not denote superiority in terms of styling, performance, handling, etc but they do denote what combination of these the consumer prefers. The wholesale increase in HP across most of the models in this discussion is an example. I am amused by the comments I see here insinuating that ""Joe Blow"" buys mediocre cars and some individuals are above that because they buy cars that they have somehow defined as ""different"". Superiority in the marketplace is what every manufacturer is seeking. That marketplace is however defined differently by different manufacturers. Ferrari does not have the same sales goals as Honda, Nissan, Toyota but they do have some numbers they want to meet in order to maintain their place in whatever market they decide is important to them.
You can't discount sales as a very important indicator. The reference to McDonalds is an attempt to deride one of the most globally successful businesses. It doesn't matter if Joe Blow eats there and you don't. Other businesses would kill for McDonald's success in their market. Freedom of choice is a wonderful thing. The marketplace inevitably determines what survives and sales figures are the feedback from the marketplace to the manufacturers. It will also inevitably determine what you get on your new car in the future. Navigation systems weren't on any cars a few years ago.
The sales figures for the new TL reflect an acceptance on the part of the consumer that Acura is on the right track with their blend of styling, handling, performance etc.
The new Acuras will drive changes to BMW , Nissan , Toyota and others just as they drove the changes to the new TL.. Competition is also a wonderful thing. The consumer wins in the end.
Most of the discussion on this board is ""my car is better than your car"" supported by whatever article, personal experience or personal opinion the author chooses to use to attempt to justify their position. No one is right and no one is wrong since none of it can really be objectively substantiated.

Good point Danny. And every manufacturer mentioned thus far, excels in one area or another. Nobody excels at everything. Some people look at the total package, others are more selective and buy for a characteristic or two.

That is, why do people get Ferraris and huge SUVs. Based on one or two characteristics (hope I don't have to spell 'em out). Getting an ES330 or a TL or an IS probably involves a number of characteristics, weighted averaged in the buyers mind and then rated."

Now, there is probably something to be said for those cars that have more demand than supply, and something else to be said for those cars that have more supply than demand. The raw sales totals of any given month for any given model are more or less meaningless, unless you know what business/marketing model the manufacturer has chosen for that model.

The fact that BMW could sell more M3s than it chooses to produce and Acura can sell more TLs with Nav than it can produce tells us nothing more than that the market sees both cars favorably.

Now for example, if BMW is not meeting it's 3-series sales goals since the 04 Acura TL was introduced... that's a different story altogether.

BTW, I have no idea if that is the case. It's probably more like Infiniti success with the G35 hurting the I35. Is Honda seeing demand soften for the V-6 Accord since the TL was introduced?

1529,fedlawman,"March 28, 2004 1:55AM","First of all, Let me apologize if I have mistakenly interpreted your comments as inflamatory if that wasn't your intention.

Now my response:

You do know that the IS300 and TSX both weigh about 3250 lbs, right?

You must also know that the IS300 and TSX both do 0-60, 5-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and slalom within a hair of each other (in spite of the fact that you once said the IS300 offers ""near 330i performance, luxury, and equipment for 325i price"").

Surely you will admit that, regardless of layout, the TSX is a fine performance sedan both on the street and at the track.

You should also admit that the subtleties between FWD and RWD, and the inclusion or omission of LSD is more significant to a ""sports car"" discussion than an ""entry-lux performance sedan"" discussion, since neither issue is a factor until you're driving above 8/10ths.

Now, if you simply prefer the way RWD works and feels, well that's fine. But when you insist that the ""small 4-cyl engine"" in the Acura ""lacks torque,"" or that ""the FWD 4-cyl TSX and 9-3 set the bare minimum for this category,"" you come across as a car snob putting others down because they drive an ""inferior car.""

Remember when you peppered that X-Type owner with one-years worth of magazine reviews (from European Car, MT, R&T, C&D) to prove that the X-Type wasn't as good as he thought? How do you think it made him feel?

Remember when you stated that you ""Wish we had three boards. One for FWD, one for AWD, and one for RWD. For me, there is no such thing as a ""performance"" FWDer. That is an oxymoron?""

Why wouldn't you want to compare the TSX, 9-3, 325i, and IS300 on the same board? They are objectively identical in size, luxury, comfort, and performance capabilities. To exclude a car because of its supposed ""inferior layout"" is akin to wanting the black kids to sit in the back of the school bus because you don't want to be seen associating with them.

Anyways, I know it's easy to misinterpret comments posted here because you don't ""hear"" what they're saying. Again, I apologize if I have misunderstood your intentions and taken them too personally...just consider that I may not be the only one who feels this way."

Bull. Straight up. I owned a Jetta 1.8T which is lighter than an A4 and it was a slow car. I've driven every A4 type - not including the obviously different S4, and the A4 just doesn't have any guts.

What's slow? Anything that takes more than 6, 6.5 seconds to hit 60. If you take 7 seconds to hit 60, then the car has average power. What's average?

Can't look at the sales of the 3 series/IS/G35/CTS RWD with many available body styles, tops and engines to the TSX/TL one body, one engine, one drivetrain FWD siblings.

Better to know how much to capacity the plants are, how many units the manufacturer planned on selling, how many units the manufacturer can make."

But it doesnt work with new product. New product may have those limitations, limited plant/factory, limited dealership/service station and also the need to survive but for sales purposes in that price range of sweet $30-40k, which manufacturer that doesnt have a plan to sell more.

It might work for Limited edition cars, very expensive cars where only a few people in this world can buy. But for $30-40k entry-level luxo sedan the market is more than 28k.

Are you saying that BMW's plants dont have enough capacity to make or doesnt plan to sell the car, or the manufacturer can only make 400 cars a month? they must've set the wrong pricing policy"
1538,blueguydotcom,"March 28, 2004 8:04PM","No matter what, numbers/stats/picture speaks for themself. Sales figures is a good measure for people's jugement. Can you deny that fact? Why the car doesnt sell as strong as others? Improvement needed.

I do not believe that for one second. Not for an instant. Purchase patterns do not indicate buyers are getting the vehicle they feel is best. GM sells millions more cars per year than anyone else; by sheer numbers then, your argument stands that the buyers snapping up GM products are then making some kind purchasing statement about GM quality. If anything the buyers enter knowing their car is of lesser quality than more expensive counterparts.

Do you think those 7k ppl dont enjoy the car? lol. Fortunately they are silent.

I think they bought what fit what they wanted and value played a big role. If the TL were priced the same as its competition I'm confident they wouldn't move 7k in a month.

Camry/accord/burger has nothing to do with entry-level luxury performance bcuz they are in different market segment.

It's all the same. Product. Product sales do not indicate that option is the nebulous ""best"" in a market only that some aspects of the that product appealled to more people. Great, Jack [non-permissible content removed]: The Movie was the top film for a weekend and made buckets of money. The quality is questionable, the appeal undeniable.

Price does prevent those Accord/camry buyers from buying. Everybody prefer good handling, good performance, good features. I am not saying TL has it all.

Yes value plays a role. There's a reason Wal-Mart is huge in the US. The TL is a great value for features and abilites. 33k for a car that's pretty much on par with say a 43k BMW? That's a great deal! Does it mean it's the ""best""? No. Only that people saw a 10k savings and perceived there's not much difference. They jumped on a slammin' deal.

Do you like a burger that has good handling, features and performance?, fastest in 0-60,0-100,1/4mile? :-)

Product is product. You may have different criteria for judging a car v. your food but in the end, you buy what fits that criteria. 55 billion people can eat at a Mickey D's. Good for them. Millions bought a GM last year. Great. If we go exclusively by popularity, then what happens to individuality and personal preference? Studios didn't used to release top money makers of each week? They figured out that buyers are lemmings and being the top money maker and announcing it meant more people would be inclined to see the ""best"" film the next weekend.

Ads for cars do the same things. ""Best selling mid-size SUV"", ""Best selling korean car with a V6"", etc. For a reason I can never comprehend, they pray on a concept if a majority prefers something it must be good. To each his own.

1540,riez,"March 28, 2004 8:56PM","fedlawman... We all compare cars differently. C&D's recent sport sedan test (3/04) included cars like TL, 325i, IS300, and G35 but not TSX. Automobile's huge test (10/03) included cars like IS300 and G35 as well as TSX, WRX, Lancer Evo, Mazda 6 S. I certainly do think the TSX is a legitimate comparison with 325i, IS300, etc.

Think we both like numbers. Using recent C&D data for IS300 (3/04--7 car comparison test) and TSX (7/03--full road test), both with manual transmissions and tires that are 17 inch and 215mm wide:

MSRP as tested: $31, 944 IS300 vs $28,990 TSX
Weight: 3,380 lbs vs 3,246

0-60 mph: 7.3 secs vs 7.2
5-60 mph: 7.8 secs vs 7.7
1/4 mile: 15.7 @ 90 mph vs 15.6 @ 91 mph
30-50 mph: 8.6 secs vs 10.2
50-70 mph: 8.3 secs vs 9.7

70-0 braking: 167 ft vs 185

Lane change: 64.7 mph (best in test) vs no data
skidpad: .88g vs .85

Top speed: 139 mph vs 133
 
The TSX's lighter weight and dragstrip-like 4.70:1 final drive certainly helps acceleration (vs. IS300's 3.73:1). Top gear times impacted by the depth of overdrive: the TSX's 6th is a very deep .66 overdrive vs IS300's .85.

But compare to some Automobile (10/03) data, both manual transmissions--IS300 then TSX

0-60 mph: 7.0 secs vs. 8.1
0-100 mph: 18.7 secs vs 21.l
0-110 mph: 23.0 secs vs 26.6
1/4 mile: 15.4 secs @ 92 mph vs 16.1 @ 89 mph
30-70 mph: 8.8 secs vs 8.6
70-0 braking: 183 ft vs 183

The differences in acceleration numbers are quite interesting. Go figure."

CTS.

A product is a product, if a car manufacturer thinks that way,

Be it McDonald's, Spielberg, J Crew or Acura...they're still trying to do the same thing: sell you something you really don't need. They want to create a desire. Some do it through straight value (Mcdonald's) in that segment, others through brand name recognition (J crew, nike, ralph lauren) and still others through features and value - Acura one price for everything."

1543,fedlawman,"March 28, 2004 10:03PM","Agreed.

The TSX is definitely at a disadvantage in top gear acceleration tests due to its gearing (you can really see this effect in the 270 hp TL's top gear figures!).

The reason why the TSX was excluded from the recent C&D comparo is because it was a ""$35,000 sedan comparo"" and the TSX is only $26,500. I honestly think (must admit some bias here) the TSX would have scored higher than the TL because of it's overall better balance and lack of handling vices.

I hadn't seen the Automobile numbers, but I think they look a little conservative. There's always going to be some variation from test to test but, I've owned several 8 second 0-60 cars over the years, and the TSX isn't one of them."
1544,riez,"March 28, 2004 10:53PM","fedlawman... Those who live by the numbers die by the numbers. Those are Automobile's numbers. I believe they were accurate. Same for C&D's numbers.

You have to keep in mind that each magazine has its own test methodologies. C&D, RT, MT, etc. do tell readers how they test (e.g., if they use high RPM drop clutch) and whether they adjust for atmospheric conditions. For example, C&D adjusts; R&T doesn't.

C&D: ""Acceleration: Test vehicle is loaded with driver, full tank of fuel, and 10 pounds of test instrumentation. With manual-transmission cars, wheelspin or clutch slip or both are used at the starting line to make best use of the engine's power characteristics and the vehicle's traction. All upshiftss are lift-throttle with the clutch disengaged. ... various shift points are tried to maximize performance. ... All performance results are corrected to standard atmospheric conditions.""

R&T: ""Acceleration numbers are obtained using drop-clutch starts and lift-throttle shifts."" Discusses how they don't adjust for conditions and that a statistically-significant result in ""0-60 mph, 0.3 sec.""

Best way to aggregate the data is to average all published test results.

blueguydotcom... Those are the published as-tested MSRPs. For the record, TSX from 7/03 issue and IS300 from 3/04 issue...

TSX-- Base: $26,990. As-tested: $28,990. Only option is nav system.

IS300-- Base: $29,980. As-tested: $31,944. One option is LSD. (The IS300 is an '04.)"
1545,riez,"March 28, 2004 11:01PM","fedlawman... Check out July 2003 issue of Motor Trend. Their comparison test of TSX vs C230 and 9-3 Arc. TSX had 6-speed manual.

1/4 mile: 16.0 secs @ 88.8 mph
60-0 mph braking: 124 ft

1547,riez,"March 29, 2004 12:22AM","fedlawman... Actually, the TSX did ""win"" that 7/03 MT comparison test and, even at 7.9 secs, it actually had the ""quickest"" 0-60 mph time of these three cars.

Don't get mad, but as I've said before, the TSX's small naturally aspirated 2.4L I4 just doesn't generate a ton of HP (and what it does do it needs high RPMs to do) and generates way less torque (esp. useable torque down low).

Has anyone ever seen a published test result for a TSX automatic? Wonder if it pushes 9 secs. 0-60 mph?"
1548,fedlawman,"March 29, 2004 1:11AM","Actually, Car and Driver and I see eye to eye on the TSX...we both love it. (I guess it's no secret which magazine Acura picked to spend advertising money on, huh?).

Seriously though, the general consensus is that the TSX 6-speed is a low-to-mid seven second car and the automatic adds about 1/2 second to that. Seems about right to me.

As for the small & lacking power comments, I guess it depends on what you're comparing it too. Of course the 2.4L I-4 has a displacement and power deficit compared to Nissan's 3.5 L VQ motor. What car in this segment doesn't (besides the TL)?

But compared to all the rest (Audi 3.0L, BMW 2.5L, Lexus 3.0L, Saab 2.0L, M-B 1.8L, Jaguar 3.0L), it appears that the TSX'S 200 hp stacks up just fine.

The recent C&D $35,000 sedan comparo that you mentioned had the 325i as the 3rd fastest car behind the G35 and TL (no surprise there). Consider how close the TSX and 325i are...

Remember this torque chart?

rpm 325i TSX
2000 150 149
2500 160 156
3000 168 160
3500 176 162
4000 173 164
4500 169 166
5000 172 163
5500 167 162
6000 161 159
6500 142 155
7000 --- 150

The TSX's ""little 4 cylinder motor"" is very close to the BMW's I-6, which explains why the TSX runs just a 1/10th or two behind the 325i in most acceleration tests (which is also where the IS300 ran in that C&D comparo).

Also notice that the Honda I-4 offers 90% of peak torque (166) from 2000 RPM all the way to 7000 RPM...that's a 5000 RPM-wide powerband to play with! How many cars can make that claim?

So let me agree with you up to a point. The TSX engine is small and underpowered compared to the G35 and TL. Compared to every other car in this segment, it's a force to be reckoned with."
1549,blueguydotcom,"March 29, 2004 6:07AM","You keep that TSX engine perculating and it's torque is enough to make it pull confidently. I prefered the free-revving, liquid smooth 2.4 in the TSX to the tighter, punchless 2.5 in the 325i.

Not sure what you mean by consensus? Is that what people want to believe? The three published data points I found have a 7.73 average. Two results are close (8.1 and 7.9) with the C&D 7.2 being the exception. C&D's number is adjusted for conditions so we don't know what the actual track result was. Doesn't appear R&T has tested a TSX, yet. Anyone got data from AutoWeek? Has CR tested one?

Seems like the published data would have TSX manual around 8.0. No idea about automatic, but think it possible it might add up to 1 second (ATs tend to sap smallish low torque I4s)--which would be in line with what AT did with Integra."

Why?

If you take a 1.8 liter four banger and apply only 7.45 PSI of boost, you will have an engine that should exactly equal the output of that same 1.8 mill with two more cylinders added. Sounds like a 2.7 liter I6 or V6 to me. Then again, if I'm not mistaken, Audi has the waste gate on the 1.8t set MUCH higher than 7.45 PSI, that should put it into the 3+ liter range as far as output is concerned.

That's why they make different cars for all of us. I owned a 1.8T it was a fun, punchy little engine.

For a 4 banger it is extremely quick.

Stop right there. I don't rate things on a scale of ""for a....[insert modifier] it was good."" Either it's good or not. In the realm of engines either it produces enough power to satisfy me or it doesn't. On a scale of 1-10 I'd put the 1.8T at about a 6. Still a failing grade. don't worry, my ZHP's engine would only rate about a 7.5 or so. An 8 would be too generous.

Comparing it to or an I6 or a V6 is unfair.

No it's not. I'm comparing it against all engines. BTW, it competes in a class with 6's. And if it's any consulation after driving a 325i I knew I couldn't buy it partly because I felt power wise that would be a lateral move from my 1.8T. Why spend 30k to get the same power output (with less useable torque too) that I had on my 21k car?!"

I think the HP figures on the 1.8T are underrated. I have a Mazda Millenia with a 2.5L V6 and my A4 leaves the Mazda in it's dust. Not only that but as I mentioned above, spend a few hundred dollars on a chip and even V6's can be had for lunch."
1556,shipo,"March 29, 2004 4:50PM","I was talking about a bone stock 1.8t. That thing should be running something like 8-11 PSI of boost which should give it at least the same output as any decent 2.5 liter normally aspirated engine currently on the market. To take it to 200HP, my ballpark guess that it would need maybe 14-17 PSI and to take it to 250HP would require boost of somewhere north of 20 PSI.

Like it or not, it is absolutely fair to compare a blown 1.8 to a larger normally aspirated engine ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 liters.

The TSX on the other hand had a nice long 6th that I could slip into and let the car glide along. Then again, I prefer that i must go from 6th to 4th or 3rd when I'm on the freeway and I want power in my ZHP. In 6th, I'm cruising and therefore I want it as quiet and loafing as possible. The taller the gear the better. 2500 rpm at 85 sounds perfect.

1562,riez,"March 29, 2004 11:59PM","Keep in mind the TSX uses a dragstrip-like 4.73:1 final drive. That gives it the initial launch. It also then has overdrive 5th and 6th gears to offset this final drive. The 6th overdrive is very deep at 0.66:1.

The IS300 uses 3.73:1 final and 0.85: 5th.

BMW has been using direct drive 5th (1.00:1) in past E46 323i/325i with various final drives under 3.50:1. The new 6-speeds bring overdrive. [My '98 540i6 had a .82 overdrive 6th with a 2.82:1 final drive.]"

I liked the fact that the coupe and sedan are so different but look similar enough. I guess people love or hate the sedan and mostly love the coupe. If I wasn't looking at coupes I would look at all sedans independently of the coupe sister. The fact that they are different should be good - the 3 coupe and sedan are virtual twins. I think the 4 series is the answer to that however."

The new rumored G refreshing as well as the rumored slew of new product from BMW will make the next few years quite interesting.

While my car operates like a ""top"", I am not married to BMW. Having driven the ""epitome"" of the sports sedan I understand why the press and enthusiast people likes these cars. But I like diversion in my car ownership experience. Can you say ""batter up"" for the G35. Of course, I don't know what I will do at this point in year and a half from now."

In short I loved everything about the car except the engine/pickup. I don't think there is a better looking car inside or out in this class than the A4 w/USP. However with the 1.8t engine and a automatic its all show and not much go. The V6 is needed if you get an A4 with the automatic, imo.

gbrozen.I can't remember what your first choice was? At the auto show I observed a salesman showing a 60+ year old couple smitten with the S40.I waited till they left and then asked him what makes the S40 that much better than the Mazda 3....he didn't know.There was a barrier around the car but he let me sit in it.The vertically arranged buttons on the center console is strange looking.If you convince yourself enough that the console is trying to make a statement then you'll be ok.
The interior of the S40 is smaller than the S60.The back seat is cramped for an adult.It may not fit all baby car seats.It's a beautiful car but basically too small for my needs.

The Legacy GT 2005 was stunning...as beautiful as G35,TL.It was on an elevated platform but I could see the interior was just as cool.The rep said they would be coming out in May and msrp around 30k usd but tba."

1591,pg48477,"April 2, 2004 3:38AM","Acura is talking about introducing a revolutionary AWD system, which not only distributes torque front to rear but also left to right. I think it might be available on 05TL.

>>>
Honda Develops World&#146;s First Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive Available this fall in the Acura RL (North America) and the Legend (Japan)

TOKYO - April 1, 2004 --- Honda Motor Co., Ltd. today announced the development of a new Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive system, called SH-AWD, that provides cornering performance that responds faithfully to driver input, and outstanding vehicle stability. A world&#146;s first, the SH-AWD system combines front-rear torque distribution control with independently regulated torque distribution to the left and right rear wheels to freely distribute the optimum amount of torque to all four wheels in accordance with driving conditions. The new system will be available this fall in the Acura RL (North America) and the Legend (Japan).

By monitoring driver input and driving conditions, the SH-AWD system determines the optimum front-rear and lateral (left-right) torque distribution. This information is then conveyed to the rear differential, where direct electromagnetic clutches continuously regulate and vary front-rear torque distribution between ratios of 30:70 and 70:30, and lateral torque distribution in the rear wheels between ratios of 100:0 and 0:100. Torque is used not only for propulsion, but for cornering as well, resulting in a significant enhancement in vehicle maneuverability.

The SH-AWD system is composed of sensors to detect steering angle, lateral g, and other vehicle information; an ECU; and the rear differential. The direct electromagnetic clutches inside the rear differential, another world&#146;s first, employ electromagnets to obtain precise control over the multi-plate clutches. Built-in search coils monitor the gaps between the electromagnets and the magnetic body to achieve precise, continuously variable torque regulation.

The rear differential is also equipped with a built-in acceleration device, yet another world&#146;s first. During cornering, the track of the outside rear wheel normally falls outside the average of the tracks of the front wheels. The outside rear wheel does not rotate fast enough to keep up with the front wheels, preventing efficient transmission of torque. To counteract this problem, the SH-AWD acceleration device alters the gearing to speed up the outside rear wheel&#146;s rotation relative to the front wheels. This reduces torque transmission losses and significantly improves vehicle maneuverability.

At Honda, driving pleasure is regarded as one of the most important factors in vehicle development. The new SH-AWD system features &#147;feed-forward&#148; control, which utilizes the degree of driver input to determine appropriate torque distribution. This results in a super-neutral steering feel that responds with optimal faithfulness to the driver&#146;s handling of the steering wheel, realizing outstanding driving comfort and stability.

Question...

I picked up the latest Motor Trend today for reading on the plane ride home from DC and read the CTS, TL, 9-3, G35 comparo. All of them were automatics, and MT got the Saab to go from 0-60 in 6.9 seconds! When they did the C230, 9-3, TSX comparo last July, a 6-speed manual Saab did 0-60 in 8.3 seconds. Isn't 1.5 seconds a pretty large gap, especially considering the latest has a slush box?"
1622,pg48477,"April 3, 2004 2:35AM","Quadra-drive is totally different, it moves power from spinning wheel to the one with more traction, almost any AWD, 4WD system can do it. What Acura build is totally different, it measures actual g force and shift torque from one side to another in hard acceleration. thay use cloches in rear differential. I'm not an expert but I have not seen anything like it."
1623,dhanley,"April 3, 2004 6:59AM","6.9 seems realistic to me based on the weight, torque, etc. The less poweful previous 9-3 turbo was about that fast.

1624,kdshapiro,"April 3, 2004 2:33PM","Quadra-drive is heavy duty 4wd system that will deliver 100% of torque to any one wheel. It is meant for keeping the vehicle moving while towing a 5000lbs load.

All new awd systems vary the power front to back and left to right as measured by the electronics. BMWs system can operate with any two wheels spinning and will vary the output to any one wheel even going into a curve."
1625,mariner7,"April 3, 2004 2:45PM","For certain new M45 is going to clean RL's clock, AWD or not. That'd be the same AWD first used in minivan Odyssey. Finally it makes its way to the top of Acura sedan!

Did you see my post showing Acura was the only premium brand to lose market share in California between 2001-2003? Even Lincoln gained some, now that's saying something! BTW, Infiniti gained the most share during that period.

I finally read the MT comparo. The editors didn't have a fun time in that glorified Accord, did they? Especially when they had G for comparison. While more powerful than G, TL got beat in every performance category! But I'm sure TL is pretty good, for FWD!"
1626,rderizans,"April 3, 2004 3:14PM","On the car model sales figures (I think Danny posted them?) I noticed it said 330i and 325i. Do those figures include the AWD models? Same for the G35x. Just curious.

Also, one other thing to consider in sales figures is the distribution channel. Within 30 miles I have 4 Acura dealers, 3 BMW dealers, 2 Mercedes dealers and 1 Infiniti dealer. Also, although the G35 RWD sedan is selling near invoice in my area, the G35x and FX models are dealing on an ""MSRP minus"" basis, not an ""Invoice plus"" basis. Discounts are less than those on the BMW or Acura TL. Again, probably a reflection of lower supply rather than higher demand for my area. To me it seems that the Infiniti dealer network size hasn't caught up with the popularity of the G and FX models."
1627,jrock65,"April 3, 2004 4:15PM","Including AWD models, BMW sold 6219 3 series sedans in March. Not bad for a model near the end of its run.

The Infiniti G35 figure includes AWD models. I agree that part of why Infiniti isn't selling even more vehicles is because their dealer network size is pretty small. Hopefully this situation will be rectified as Infiniti keeps on making more hits. You gotta remember that Infiniti almost got pulled as a brand a few years ago, and only the ""lowly"" I35 kept this from happening."

Even staunch RWD supporters must admit that Honda and Acura has always given the RWD benchmarks a run for the their money in comparo's.

The Prelude, TL-S, Integra, RSX, and TSX are all examples of FWD cars that handle virtually as well as their RWD couterparts, and are repeatedly top finishers in magazine comparisons.

The TL may not be as quite as balanced as a 330i, but it certainly is an amazing sport sedan that offers an enviable blend of performance, styling, quality, luxury, and value.

People don't generally buy for the same reasons. One man's quality, is another man's cast off. In southern California when you look at new home sales, at least 90% are track homes - 2000-4000 square foot, bland, poorly built, ugly, cookie-cutter homes on flattened land with no trees. So by your logic, because most people when buying new get track homes, then home buyers in general prefer planned communities, 4 variations of homes designs and no individuality.

KB Homes, because they sell the most, using your logic, build the best homes - more people choose them. They all can't be fools, right? It's all about sales... quality, individuality, are not a part of the equation."

Quote all you want. It seems people are desperate for others to approve of their purchase. It's not good enough that you like the car, it seems important that 7k people this month did too. This is akin to people who cite box office as proof a movie is good. $1.8 billion in box office doesn't mean a film's good by default and 7k sales in a month doesn't either. The Accord sold 30k+ cars last month, I'll flat out say it, the Accord is not a good car. So 30K people made a bad decision? Maybe not for them, but I found it bulky, wallowy and just not a fun experience. On a scale of 1/10, the Accord would rank about 3 or 4 for me.

TL is the only FWD that can compete with 330i, G35, RWDer.

True, so what do sales have to do with that? I like the TL. I do not like the stigma that goes with BMW buyers and I'm not digging the vibe I'm getting from some TL buyers in here too. This reminds me of the attitude when the G35 arrived (KD I bet you remember those posts) and many G35 owners were not content to love their cars - they wanted the world to nod and say, ""You got a great deal on a BMW beater."" Time has passed and now the G35's just another legit option (unlike previous Infinitis). You don't see that attitude as much with the G. But boy has it come on strong with the TL.

So for you, you got a great deal. The TL is a wonderful car, love it for what it does for you. How do others feel about it? Does it matter? Unless they're buying you the car, what anyone else thinks of your purchase should not be relevant.

Being the best selling car in any class is a useless stat when it comes to making your buying decision. You don't automatically buy the bestselling of other products do you? So, why would it matter with a stupid toy?"

More on the TL. the recent Motor Trend comparo commented that steering was overboosted, torque steer was evident, brakes were worse in the group, and the turning circle is huge, equivalent to Dodge Ram truck. Doesn't say sport sedan to me...just a guzzied up Honda Accord with a big engine."

People here keep dissing the sales figures. The sales figures are much more of realistic indicator of the buying publics acceptance or rejection of FWD automobiles. The TL is out selling all of the RWD cars that Pat allows us to discuss on this board as entry level luxury performance sedans. I don't believe the majority of car buyers care as much about FWD versus RWD as the very small number of participants on this board do.
I know the people here who believe they are different because they don't buy cars lots of other people do will take exception. Taking exception is certainly their right but it doesn't alter the fact that Acura continues to manufacture and sell a lot of really fine FWD cars in a class dominated by RWD cars. The reason is they give a lot of value for the money and that seems to be more important to people than what kind of drivetrain the car has.

There is nothing inherently wrong with FWD. Sales only has to do with popularity, not best of breed. Even CR says the TL is basically a ""torted up"" (sic) Accord.

jrock - nobody is not saying the TL is not a good car. It offers good ""value"" for the money. You can point to the accolades fair enough as long as you point to criticsms. One of the big ones is torque-steer. Now we can debate endlessly on whether that matters to an individual. But the question is, how acceptable is it in the near-entry level sports sedan segment?

The G35 debate was different in that it got down to the precision handling of a 330 vs the more ""family oriented value"" of the G35 with less ""precision and finesse"".

The fact is that the RWD cars discussed in this topic, with a good set of winter tires mounted, will run rings around a similar FWD car running Summer tires or even All-Seasons for that matter. For my money, THAT is what truly constitutes versatile performance.

If you're not comparing V6 to V6 sales, then you're using a dubious metric. The Max is offered as the top end of the midsize range from Nissan. The 4 banger accord is specifically designed to appeal to a different buyer. Do you not grasp that? The vast majority of buyers don't give a hoot about handling, power or performance - thus the reason cars like the ES330, Accord and Fords/GMs sell well.

Do you think all those 7k people had their decision from sales figures

The truth? I think price, Honda reputation and standard equipment drive the majority of TL sales and always have. A comparable equipment wise 330i would run well over 5k more. To most buyers, imho, the lack of RWD would mean nothing to them as they buy appliances. When I help friends/family buy cars and they're looking to drop 30-40k, the general statements are, I need something reliable, something pretty luxurious, its got to have a little power.

So I'll take them out and if they drive a 33k version of a G35, TL, A4 and 325i they'll walk away most impressed by the price/power/equipment of the G, TL.

Now we all recognize there is a different value scale between Japanese and German vehicles.

""These cars are the size of sub-compacts.""

Having sat in the back of a TL and G, I can honestly say I was underwhelmed by feeling of lack of space in the back seat. So yes the 3-series is slightly smaller, but at least it doesn't *LOOK* like it should have a big back seat.

The back seat in the TL and G are *bigger*, but it is not as roomy overall as one would think given the relative sizes of these cars to the 3-series. I still felt very cramped back there."

A friend with a honda accord coupe giggles when he takes me for rides, becuase i look so uncomfortable. But the 3-series sedan is fine for me, while the coupe is not. Best car i ever sat in for me was my old 900, though. Lots of space above the noggin even with sunroof installed. The new 9-3 is not quite as ""square"" inside, which is too bad, but it still has lots of space AROUND the head. That would have been the best car ever if it had been in the shop ( a lot ) less. So, unless the TL has a lot more headroom than the old one, it might be the cramped overpriced one for me--not that anyone else might care.

Don't get me started on seats designed for people with narrow shoulders, bad posture, and big butts! Ugh!

I don't get how issues such as ""midsize"" and ""compact"" are decided. The g35 is described as a compact, but it's got more interior cubic footage than the TL and the front is larger. And, having sat in the back of the g35, it's not exactly tiny.

It depends, one of my neighboors has a 4X4 pickup with appropriate tires and a steep driveway. His pickup was at the bottom of the driveway a few times this winter. A lot of the FWD cars spun and spun before they made it up some of the more inclined driveways in the neighborhood.

Two winters ago an Accord was trying to get onto the main street up a hill out of the development. The Accord just couldn't make it up. Finally backed down the hill and went around another way. I made it up the hill albiet with a little help from DSC. The Accord was not much older than my car and the tires looked okay to me.

Like it or not, with modern traction control, it is virtually impossible to get the back end to hang out, even on purpose, unless you switch off the electronics.

I got my drivers license thirty years ago and I have extensive experience driving AWD, FWD and RWD cars in horrible conditions on roads all over the world, and FWIW, I feel much safer driving fast in slippery conditions in a car where the front wheels aren't at the mercy of engine power as to whether or not they have any grip.

Haha, I kinda dig the current one too (in a weird way)! Maybe it's because I only see one once in a blue moon.

""You forgetting one thing though, Nissan also spend less then any other manufacturer on the vehicle, result is big profit margin.""

Nissan spends its money on engine/drivetrain, Toyota spends its money on nice interiors, and Honda does a combo of both, although it doesn't lead in either.

Well, we'll have a better idea in a few days.

With the upcoming GS, M, RL, and A6, to go along with the 5 and the E, we're gonna need a second board lest we get booted by the moderator for talking about them. That segment is really going to heat up.

I'll go ( 328i )

1) Leather not aging that well
2) 80mph=3500RPM ( not that loud, but gas? )
3) Air cond not enough for five people in new mexico on hot day day. Takes time to cool car even in chicago.
4) Paint seems to chip/scratch easier than on my old saturn ( and, i mean, come on )
5) Cupholder specifically designed to hold no cup in the universe.

My old '900

1) Rusty underbody areas even after 4 years in new mexico
2) 65/35 weight split--felt as if there was a cinder block in front of the axle.
3) Dealer-set timer would make the car return for expensive repair every 4-5 months.
4) One dealer in town, and they knew it. ""Yes, we are changing you wife's brake fluid for the third time in six months.""
5) Turbo lag annoying a sea level, terrifying at 8,000 feet.

Outside the building I work in are parked a new 350Z, a new M5, lots of 3 series in every flavor,
my TL, new 3.5 Maxima and others. All nice cars and some I know for sure I would be very happy with ( as in M5 or 350Z ).
I wish we could see honest discussion here about some things that aren't what we thought they would be or need improving on the cars we bought. Most of the critic isms are aimed at cars we don't own. I'll go first..what the hell was Acura thinking when they designed the steering wheel location relative to the instrument panel ? You can't see the speedometer when the wheel is adjusted to where you want it. Maybe it is different for others depending on their driving position but neither my wife or I can see the speedometer with the wheel where we want it.
That doesn't detract from my driving enjoyment enough to outweigh the things I do like however.
I am going to drive three hours each way to play golf on Friday and one of the reasons is because I like driving my TL and I get the best of two worlds..a nice course and a nice drive. I am positive I would have an equally good time in G35 or a 330I or certainly in that M5.
I bought a TL because it suited me in the areas I considered important...price, styling and also it was car my wife also enjoys driving. I am sure the others here did the same.

1753,shipo,"April 6, 2004 8:44PM","The good news is that the issues that I've had with my last two cars are really nothing more than nits so to speak, no show stoppers. ;-)

Issues with the 2002 530i:

1) It too has the steering wheel blocking the top of the speedo issue.
2) Adaptive throttle by wire software takes a bit getting used to, I prefer a simple linear throttle.
3) Tire noise as the OEM Pilot-Primacys wear.
4) The space taken up with the silly sliding arm rest could have easily been used for a small storage console.
5) For about 500 miles or so I was bumping against that arbitrary 128 mph speed governor while on the AutoBahn. The car clearly has more legs than that.
6) Cup holders that are so ridiculous that I actually forgot my car even had any (real low priority issue for me anyway).
7) Brake dust.

Issues with the 1999 328i:

1) DING! When ever the OAT hit 37 degrees the display would change and DING at me, forcing me to acknowledge the information by pushing a button or else my chosen display would be stuck on the OAT.
2) No two zone HVAC. The 1998 E36 328i had it, my 530i has it, and even our two Dodge Caravans have it. I like it cool, my wife likes it hot and the 328i was difficult to deal with when we were both in the car.
3) The 128 mph governor, not that I ever felt its influence on this car, at least legally anyway. ;-)
4) Brake dust.

2) 80mph=3500RPM ( not that loud, but gas? )
80 mph in 6th gear - we're talking over 30 mpg and around 3k with almost 4k more to go.

3) Air cond not enough for five people in new mexico on hot day day. Takes time to cool car even in chicago.

Open the windows and doors remotely. By the time I get to the car it's air temp. Within 2-3 minutes it's an ice box.

4) Paint seems to chip/scratch easier than on my old saturn ( and, i mean, come on )

Your saturn was plastic wasn't it? Isn't that injection molded? Anyway, 1 year, 15k miles not a scratch on the whole car.

5) Cupholder specifically designed to hold no cup in the universe.

Will take just about any cup known to man - though nobody better sip anything in my car or they'll die.

Guess BMW did improve things.

Things that aren't good with my 330i:
1. The parking brake broke.
2. Horrible rearward vision.
3. Clumsy HVAC that require me to spin a dorky dial - it's not an auto system and BMW calling it that is a lie.
4. Lousy Harmon Kardon stereo with no MP3 ability and one disc.
5. Lack of torque until the revs are super high.
6. Not nearly enough power.
7. Handling isn't sharp enough.
8. Double-pull to unlock doors.

4. Wish trunk was bigger, at least the same size as my '00 TL.
5. I solved my squeaks and rattle issues but once in a long while, one will mysteriously occur and then just as mysteriously disappear (very random and difficult to locate).
6. Torque steer - It's mild (not excessive as some people believe) but it's there.
7. I have to be careful with my keys in hand and seat belt buckle because the interior aluminum trim does dent easily.
8. On cold morning starts, the engine may idle rough for a couple of minutes.

10. Glove box and center console storage compartment could be bigger, and I really miss the center overhead sunglasses compartment like the one in my '00 TL.

If you go prepaid, what's the buyout after 36 months?

A few months back, my comparo shopping started with the BMW 330i Sedan. With the all the options I wanted, it didn't take long for the price to reach and exceed CDN$50,000. Then the TL came along and for about CDN$10,000 less, my needs were greatly satisfied.

2. The front dash side vents have chrome stripes on the louver directional levers that reflect in the door glass about eye level with the side mirrors. The solution is to black them out with a marker pen.

3. You can't deactivate the skid control. I found VSC to be a little intrusive during a trip to the local race track on a wet day

4. The traction control is way to sensitive. Fortunately you can turn it off so you can take full advantage of the Limited slip.

5. Shock valving. on the e-shift car is a little too soft when you approach the handling limits of the car.

Most of GS, E and 5 are being sold with 6 cylinders, in fact 80% of GS is I6.

Well, for $18,000 more, I'd hope it could eat G's and TL's for lunch.

I have no doubt that Honda and Nissan have the engineering to produce much more hp and performance from their current engines. It's all a matter of cost. To them, it's not cost effective to do so at this time; to BMW, it is.

You make it sound as if BMW has been just sitting around since the intro of the current 3 in MY1999. They've been upgrading the car, especially from an engine standpoint. When it first came out, it was a 2.8L engine, then BMW upgraded to a 3.0L. Your ZHP and its engine modifications were introduced only last year.

Who cares if BMW uses a 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, or 3.5? Bottom line is performance/features/cost.

""But I do find it hilarious that people are saying the G35/TL is hot on the 3 series when both are 2 years old or less while the bimmer debuted in 98 as a 99""

I find nothing hilarious about it. So when the new 3 comes out in MY2006, can we no longer compare it to the G and the TL?

The only real difference is that BMW leaned toward the performance and handling niche whereas the Japanese leaned toward the simplicity and reliability niche, historically speaking.

To put this in context, I was doing a project for MB-USA in the mid 1990s and the folks from Stuttgart liked what I did for the folks in Montvale, and shipped me over there for a while. Due to the fact that I was a contractor, their insurance regulations prohibited me from being assigned a car from the pool reserved for the MB-USA folks, so they rented me a small BMW. Said rental had four doors, a 1.6 or a 1.8 liter mill (I think it was the 1.6), crank windows, no A/C, cloth seats and a simple radio without a cassette. To make matters worse, I was driving north out of Austria early one morning (about 4:00 AM) and the 316i was laboring up a long hill south of Ulm, flat out at something like 80 mph when I saw a pair of headlights catching me, FAST. No sooner had I finished passing a string of even slower moving cars and moved over to my right, a Chrysler MiniVan passed me doing well over a buck twenty!

No one can say the bimmer engineers aren't good at refining a sedan and engineering the heck out of it over time. But in its first try nissan bested the true class competitor (330i) and is redefining the expectations of this segment. It's truly a joy to own a G and hear people compare the car to much more powerful or expensive machines such as m3 and any 5 series as the car seems to find it self compared to so often. The m3 is over 50k and is not much bigger than a civic. While very beautiful and classic in design it's very pricey for the propeller on the hood and the extra oophm. Worth it - maybe if you can swing it. Maybe last year and not next year tho. Its another whole class the M3 sits in with a 911 carerra and the vette that we are comparing a 27k car to....very cool to me.

Now as for the VQ being tame - yes it's not pushing all the M hp/liter but thats a $17,000 motor with a 1% failure rate from such a long stroke working at 9k rpm. Nice but quirky and expensive. The VQ can easily perform 300hp without any major tweaks and could possibly get to 340 or so if tuner like the M guys tune the VQ. Maybe still not the same high hp/litre as m3, but much cheaper much more reliable and still more productive than 99% of the v6's sold in the us. I'll take it.

For 1k you can take the existing 260 in the sedan and turn it into 290 or so. Thats an 11% increase with minor work and dollars.

S4, M3, 330i ZHP, C32, TL (mt & auto), G35 coupe 6mt, M45, S60R, E500 (just out of curiosity).

I agree with recent posts regarding, ""to each his own,"" and for me, I need a sedan (6 & 4 year olds); it needs to be relatively quick (low-mid 6s 0-60, 14s-15s 1/4); and while this may be snobbish(a word?), I don't want to see myself coming and going on every roadway (i.e some exclusivity).

My own observations:
S4/M3--awesome acceleration, ride too firm, Audi's gas mileage horrendous, Bimmer pricey;
C32--great ride & acceleration, pricey, weak interior;
S60R--not bad, do I want a Volvo?, auto is alot slower than mt (wife cannot drive mt, despite my best efforts);
G35 coupe--it's a coupe, great looking, quick, ride relatively good, interior a bogey, great bang for buck, need to try sedan, hoping '05 interior improved;
TL--great bang for buck, I wish speedo and tach were given equal real estate, otherwise great interior (one must admit lots of BMW cues, inside & out), fast enough (for me);
M45--included here because one can be had significantly below sticker, fast, comfy, exclusive, ride a little floaty, interior nice but redundant controls take too much real estate;
330i ZHP--I must admit, I really like its lines, ride, fast enough (BMW definitely low-balls its hp ratings--I believe my E36 M3 had 240hp, was lighter, and slower? c'mon! However, I live in MD, where we do receive snow/ice, and I hear those 18"" rims bend frequently...

330 perf package costs way more than what you can get into a G35 for. If you ""tuned"" your VQ yourself spending the money you saved you'd end up ahead.

BMW doesn't have any voo-doo HP tricks that others lack. It's a question of money. The specific output of the 325 is very low, just look at a 98-00 Duratec 2.5 pumping 200hp... that was 6 years ago mind you.

I also notice that none of the TL lovers here are touching the Motor Trend comparison. About the torque steer, they basically wrote ""sure you could live with it, but why would you want to""? (not an exact quote, i don't have the mag here in front of me)

To sum it up:
The G35 dominated since there was no BMW competition. But the CTS keeps creeping up in these comparisons, coming in second this time. It pulled a 6.6 with an auto, which will probably mean a 6.2 when the M6 hits lots this June as an '05. So I could drive a 5 series in size and comfort that goes 6.2 for as little as $32k or I could force my friends to cram into the back of a 3 series and either spend a little more money for equal performance (regular 330) or spend way more for slightly better performance (330 perf package). No thanks, I'm not into paying more for less just to have what everyone else thinks is ""cool"". I work hard for my money and the status symbol factor of BMW does nothing for me.

For me, a person who needs to use the back seat at times, but still wants a balanced sports sedan the G35/CTS are clearly the value leaders.

First try? Nissan's had the I class for a long time and it was in the same market segment: entry level lux. The G comes a good 10 years into Nissan's first failed attempts.

It's truly a joy to own a G and hear people compare the car to much more powerful or expensive machines such as m3 and any 5 series as the car seems to find it self compared to so often.

Who would compare a G to an M3? There is no comparison. That's beyond silly. comparos to the 530 make sense. The 545? No way.

The m3 is over 50k

Starts at 45k.

and is not much bigger than a civic.

You're the only one doing that. Quite frankly the G's a fun car, but it's not in the same league as the M3, 911 or Vette - those are flat out performance cars. When you're running sub 5 second 60s then it'll be called a GT-R.

The VQ can easily perform 300hp without any major tweaks and could possibly get to 340 or so if tuner like the M guys tune the VQ.

Again, so, it's also much larger. We've seen over 350 out of the 3.2 on the M3 CSL.

For 1k you can take the existing 260 in the sedan and turn it into 290 or so.

Stock for stock. I don't care what mods are out there. Kids are on the road with Civics pushing over 400 hp. Doesn't change the fact it's still a Civic.

The G's a fine car but it's not Nissan's first foray into entry-level-lux and it's certainly not in the league of cars like the M3, 911 or Vette, STi, Evo. To believe it is, can only be described as foolishness."

Regardless, this all began because someone babbled about the G35 and TL outgunning the 3 series. I don't see it that way. I see that they finally caught up with it - while posting high HP numbers. And still they aren't winning comparos straight up. It's only when adding price that they win some of the comparo....and to some buyers, price wasn't the determining issue when buying a car for fun. Afterall, it's a toy. If i'm tossing 33k on a car, 6k more is not that big of a deal in the scheme of things. If 6k means 10% more happiness, the trade off is a no brainer, in my opinion.

I think in the end I'm buying my sports sedan for a different reason: fun. Roominess, bang for the buck, modability don't enter my equation."
1843,shipo,"April 8, 2004 3:56PM","While the CTS may have decent acceleration, it's the rest of the package that turns me off. It looks like a Piccaso characature of what I'm not sure, the interior is a serious turn off to me, and don't get me started on the handling which felt to me less stable and precise than our family Caravans much less than either of my BMWs.

Personally, I think that the G and the 330i (with just the regular SP, not the ZHP) are well matched, the G has a little more room and depending on the day may be a little faster, the 330i has a higher quality interior and depending upon the day is a better handler. I will not speculate on the E46 replacement but I wouldn't bet against the BMW engineers on that one.

Had the 3.6 liter engine, which seemed atheletic enough. Nice sized interior and trunk. Way too much plastic inside, with some cost cutting parts evident here and there.

I'd like to try the CTS-V in the near future, but I suspect a test drive will be hard to obtain. And I still cannot decide how I feel about the exterior design, although it is beginning to grow on me, I think...

BTW, the 2003 E500 I drove is quite nice, and probably can be had for a relative bargain."

I previously owned a '98 3 series, and can honestly say that the handling performance of the CTS is on par with the bimmer, in everyday driving that is. On the track, it maybe a different story, but for real world driving, the Caddy performed well above my expectations (especially when you add in the fact it is a larger vehicle)."

1851,scott1,"April 8, 2004 7:00PM","I agree with sawyerjon on the performance of the CTS with the new 3.6 liter engine. I traded in a navy blue 99 corvette for my luxury sport package equipped CTS, so I know how a true sports car is supposed to handle. While the CTS obviously doesn't have the horsepower that the corvette does, it handles extremely well...with tight responsive steering and brisk throttle response. The engine has a nice refined purrr to it too.
  Before ordering the CTS, I spent a month driving every other competitor I could think of, from BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, Infinity, even a Lincoln LS. The only one I didn't consider was Honda/Acura. I had a really bad ownership experience with a Honda some years ago..and can't bring myself to buy another.
   For what I am looking for in a car at this point in my life, the CTS fit the bill better then anything else. It has room and comfort, very satisfying handling and acceleration, the luxury feel that I think I deserve, and bold styling that sets it apart from the crowd and turns heads on the road.

As far as engine prowess you'd need to get the m3 to really have anything over on the G regardless of displacement. As we i believe agree, the zhp and the G sedan stocker is dead even for almost any category. At upper highway speeds the G may have a chance to outshine a tad.

And really price is an issue or we'd all be in maserati or lambo. Price is not an issue for a certain bracket or segment but you are still locked into that segment. I got to save 7 k from the 40k zhp and i can hang with it so i dont feel i compromised within my class...and ZHP is really a class higher imo (between m and 330)."

Exterior has had minor updates as well (trunk lid dropping that ugly grey and gaining a body color license bezel, better wheels, better onstar antenna style and positioning).

Ultimately, you have to like the styling of the car you're buying if you're a car guy. If you don't, no use trying to force it.

Dropping an extra $6000 is an easy decision for you? More power to you.

You eluded to a perf package 330 being $39k by saying if you were spending 33 what was a $6k more. I just priced out a 330 perf pack with just enough options so that it would equal a G35 or CTS in fairly basic form. MSRP came to $45k.
So that 330 with perf pack is at the VERY least $10k more than a G35 or CTS.

Putting price aside... The 3 series sedan simply isn't big enough for a trip of any length to have adults in the back seat, unless they're all of shorter statue. If you're very well off and don't need to carry more than two people around for any serious amount of time and the BMW speaks to your soul, enjoy.

When it comes to happiness, yes. In the scheme of things if I keep the car for 3 years and paid it off, that'd be 2k a year. I'm not going to be unhappy for 2k a year. As I'm leasing it (for less than a comparable time/mileage lease of a 30k G35), I'm really paying maybe 200-300 extra a year. Is your auto bliss worth $50 a month? $2 a day? Mine is.

That's my response to people who brag they paid cash for a car - 30-40k. I'd rather drop that as a downpayment on a house, rent the place, get 20% ROI a year and a fat tax write off.

True - the styling of the G and TL strike me as conservative and safe with a slight twist. The Audi's got a gorgeous Bauhaus thing going. The 3's sporting a classic crouched feline look. The IS,to me, goes more for an anime, blocky, smoothed over thing - I can't help but think of Japanese cartoons when I see them.

Torque steer happens when you accelerate quickly from a stop. The car will pull to the right and may need correction to keep it straight. I think the biggest problem with the TL is not so much torque steer but the fact that it is too nose heavy. The latter affects handling and braking. Notice that the best handling sedans have nearly 50/50 weight distribution."

I know exterior is subjective but do you seriously think the G35 coupe does not have a muscular look to it. If that is the case than you are in the minority.

I also think this car is a love it or hate it type of car. I would fall into the hate it category. The new STS is a big improvement in styling over the CTS.
As far as exclusivity goes. I don't know where you drive but the only types of autos around here that stand out are your lamborghini,rolls,etc...I have never given a second look to a CTS.

 Although, I rarely see an M45 around town, maybe the CTS falls along the same lines.......relax caddy fans, I'm just kidding, I know the CTS outsells the M45 by a wide margin."

For instance, there is a grade on I-80 heading east from Hackensack toward the George Washington Bridge. On that grade, what with all of the traffic that road gets, the asphalt in each lane has been pressed into what sort of looks like an old country dirt lane. The lane divider regions and the middle of the lanes are an easy two to three inches higher than the rutted area where the tires typically run. When climbing that hill with anything beyond the power necessary to maintain your speed, the car starts to wander around the ruts. It is a very nervous feeling, and depending upon the quality of the car and its suspension, the phenomena ranges from mildly distracting to highly annoying, in fact, I&#146;ve driven a few cheap rentals up that grade that were down right scary. I've also driven a number of RWD cars up that same grade and never experience a single wander, regardless of how much I was into the GO pedal.

Don&#146;t know about &#147;seldom&#148; use of these. Even if you don&#146;t take a car to performance limits its capabilities enable safer driving. A better performing car will allow you to accelerate and brake from trouble. A better handling car will allow radical maneuvering away from trouble. People tend to think sports cars are dangerous. I think they are akin to good preventive medicine and are the safest cars you can buy.

In emergency-handling tests, the TL demonstrated good tire grip and cornering balance, and it proved secure in our avoidance maneuver, where it posted a quick 52.5-mph.

I took a five hour road trip to Eastern Washington and back to play golf today and to just drive my TL. Great road to drive leading up to a mountain pass and through a gorgeous canyon with a river running next to the road. The TL is such a nice road car. I wasn't throwing it around as some do mostly because the road is notorious for state police and sure enough they were out at 7:00 AM when I was driving over. Sun was up at 7:00 and I drove home in 80 degree temperatures. I really got a dose of what a near luxury sport sedan is about.
The car is extremely comfortable, great sound system, fun to drive fast when you can and I got 30 miles per gallon coming home because there was enough traffic you couldn't really drive fast. I didn't feel any torque steer and I was doing 80 through some of the corners going over in the morning.
There surely are some differences in the cars being discussed here but the numbers are so small as to be almost inconsequential in most cases (.89 versus .90 skidpad..5.6 versus 5.8 0-60)
I believe the kind of driving I did today is the true measure of a near luxury sport sedan because I think it represents the kind of driving that 99% of the people who own these cars actually do. I am sure that my trip would have been just as enjoyable in a 330I or a G or an IS 300. I just happen to own a TL and today I was really pleased that I do."

1910,shipo,"April 10, 2004 4:32PM","Hmmm, my definition if ""Tramlining"" is when you are driving on roads, primarily in California, that have parallel grooves cut in them for water relief so as to help prevent hydroplaning.

My definition of ""Torque Steer"" is when the driven front wheels take steering matters into their own hands when power is applied, especially during a turn or when the road surface is sloped.

When I described the phenomena on I-80, which is (relatively) smooth asphalt and has two ruts, one for the left tire and one for the right, I was referring to Torque Steer, at least according to my definition.

Best Regards,
Shipo"
1911,speedracer3,"April 10, 2004 4:40PM","Definition: The annoying tendency of some front-wheel drive vehicles to pull to one side when engine torque is applied. In other words, you step on the gas and the car wants to steer right or left. By redesigning the power train to use equal length half shafts between the transaxle and wheels, the tendency towards torque steer can be greatly reduced. The other cure is to keep off the gas"

- Climate control fan is too noisy and not enough AC for the fan speed
- Not enough low end torque with 4WD

Things I like about the Audi:
- interior quality
- steering is impeccable
- Bose is excellent
- Shifter and clutch like butter

I drove a G35 6MT a few months ago for curiosity. Great engine and steering. Things I didn't like:
- Interior is only fair after having an Audi
- Steering - I drove about 70 mph around a sweeping freeway interchange ramp. There's a spot where the pavement changes and there's a 1/2-1 inch elevation difference. When I hit it in the G35 the steering wheel wanted to jerk out of my hand - THAT'S the sort of real-world handling I DON'T like! I tried the same spot and speed later in my A4 and there was virtually no 'kick' in the steering wheel. In conclusion, the interior and this steering behavior were enough to rule out the G35 for me.

Clarification on my previous post: I liked the steering FEEL of the G35, but when hitting bumps while in a turn at high crusing speed (moderate amount of lateral G's), the steering jerked quite readily, while my A4 does not do that. Yet the A4 retains an excellent road feel, as does the G35."

Once, leaving taos there was a row of 20 cars all bumper to bumper climbing uphill at 25mph. I knew i'd never be able to pass the entire caravan on the windy road ahead. So i dropped to second, and passed 25 cars on a long uphill, redlining third at the end. It paid off; there was hardly any other cars on the road following that, and the twisties were great fun.

First of all, the RWD and sport suspension make the C class a better handling car (sorry TL/TSX lovers, but I am another ""RWD or bust"" kind of guy). Secondly, my car MSRP was 32K and I paid 31K for C2 package (rain sensor, power rear sunshade and power sunroof), 6 disc changer, heated seats and premium Bose system. IMO, the look of the C CLass is MUCH classier and all around better looking than the non descript Honda lineup; especially the sport sedans 17inch wheel/tire combo and side/front/rear skirting. And if cjs2002 can wait for the '05 MB cclass sport sedan the interior is far better looking than the '03 or '04. The TL interior is a nice piece, but it still screams Accord. And in the reliability department, my car has only been to the shop for it's one routine/free scheduled maintenance at 10K (I currently have 14K miles).

Honestly, cjs2002, you won't go wrong with either car, but the C CLass was an easy choice for me last January when I ordered mine. Even over the much loved G35 sedan. . . .IMO I just don't love the exterior or interior of the G.

The fuel gauge was about 2 gallons off and replaced (the sending unit) and the tape deck door would not open - the entire head unit was replaced. Everything under warranty. So that was 2 problems. If I bought a Japanese car I would expect 1 problem in 32,000 miles. The car is solid as brick - no squeeks or rattles at all. According to the last service my
brake pads are not even at 50% wear which is not bad cosidering 80% of my driving is in the city. The 6-speed can easily get 30 miles per gallon on the highway.

This ""Entry Level Performance Sedans"" discussion is about a number of vehicles - you can read pat Mar 19, 2004 6:34 to see the list.

Our discussions get ""categorized"" based on what they are about. Since this discussion includes the G35, that vehicle is one of the categories, and that means when you list discussions that include the G35, this one shows up. But it doesn't mean that the only subject here is the G35.

I hope this helps explain things, but if not, feel free to drop me an email.

1951,glenford,"April 14, 2004 12:14AM","Finally got to drive a G35x today (nearest dealer is 50+ miles away) on my way to the NY auto show. Looking for some feedback from others who have driven both this and either a 325xi or 330xi - I drove both of those a month ago (that dealer only 45 miles away - in a different direction).

My needs list - AWD, highly reliable, ""compact"" size, fun to drive, and it falls off after that. Price is a consideration.

My observations:
AWD performance - I'll never know from a test drive not in nasty snow - assume they are both good.

Price - G35x, by a couple thousand or more, depending on if I compare to 325 or 330.

Reliability - varies by the individual car, of course, but Infiniti looks to have (significantly?) better odds

Size - comparable, but the BMW seemed a little cramped to me (the oft-repeated comments about the ""grade"" of the interior between the two is of lesser concern to me - both are fine)

Fun - This is a little harder, since the lag between my drive times was long, but here's how it felt, and I'm looking for your observations:

There is a noticeable power difference between the 325 and the other 2. Maybe daily it doesn't matter, but it's easy to feel. Otherwise, the power seemed to me to come on much more smoothly in the 330 than the g35. G35 might ride better, but I also felt that it was a little over-sensitive to minor inputs, and I didn't feel that in the BMW. They all braked strongly (as much as I can test in a test drive).

I'm not looking to restart the ""I love my xxx, it's the best"" wars, but I would be interested in hearing from those who have driven both (or all 3). All are seemingly very nice - even near-luxury (!) cars.

Interesting cars from the show (in their AWD versions, which sometimes means coming soon) - Lexus 2005 GS, Saab 9-2 (even if it is a Subaru ;-), Acura RL (but too big for me). Acura said all their cars would be AWD if I wanted to wait. Infinity M (again too big, though). It was crowded down there today, bad weather or not."
1952,rderizans,"April 14, 2004 1:20AM","I had a '99 328i for just over five years and purchased a G35x back in January. I test drove the 325ix and 330ix as well as the A4 1.8T and 3.0. My opinions were similar to yours:

- BMW engines are the smoothest out there and my 328i was the smoothest of any car I've ever driven (I think they get better with age). If the ABS system hadn't gone (~$3000 estimated to repair), I'd still be driving it for sure. The G35 engine is great and VERY powerful, but somehow not as much fun to rev to the redline as the BMW engines.
- 325 and Audi engines just didn't have enough torque for me. The Audi felt nice, but the throttle response wasn't there for me.
- G35 is bigger than the other cars. Significantly in overall size, somewhat less significantly in interior room but still, it's a bigger car with more room, which was a positive for me.
- Handling was similar in all - excellent.

As you can see, I like all of the cars. In the end, the decision for me came down to value and reliability. The G35x simply is a great value when compared to the BMWs and Audis. Sure, the interior plastics aren't quite up to snuff, but the leather is nicer (in my opinion), it's the most powerful in the group, and your reliability odds are definitely better with Inifiniti.

No matter which you choose, you'll love the car. It's a great choice to have!"
1953,jrock65,"April 14, 2004 2:57AM","I agree w/ rderizans that the leather in the G is nicer. But I prefer softer leathers.

The biggest weakness of the G is grade of interior materials (other than seats), but if you're not bothered by them, the G35x should be a top candidate. Seeing that the power difference (or lack thereof) in the 325ix was noticeable to you, I'd recommend not getting it. Might nag you constantly. The 330ix is a fine machine, you can't go wrong with it either."

I must admit before I test drove the 325ci(w/sport)I expected the car to be a dog and much to my surprise it was reasonably fast. The 330i(w/sport) was a wonderful car to drive. It was smooth and felt like it took far less effort to pick up speed. I have nothing negative to say about how the 330i drives. I just think the look is a little dated to me and the 3 series around here are far too common.

When my G35coupe was in for service I was given a G35X( I happened to get caught in the middle of an unexpected snow storm. It handled very well. I never had any problems the entire day. Now, it was not on the same level as my wife's A6 quattro but the car handling capabilities are more than adequate. I prefer the interior of the 3 series but I agree with some others on this board with regard to the seats. The seats are more comfortable in the G."

1. In March, something was wrong on the car, I called, they scheduled it 3 weeks later. I asked, if they can make it earlier, because I was not sure if the problem was critical or not. They said, they can, but they don't have loaner, I have to rent a car at my own expense.

2. 10 days ago, my car was hit by a lost-control car, some bodyworks need to be done, I have to rent a car myself. ( I don't blame them for this one.)

3. This moring, my car stopped on highway ( see my previous post). The malfunction fuel gauge showed that I have half tank of gas, actually the tank is empty. When I call the dealer, they said they can treat it as urgent service, but, again, I have to rent a car at my own expense, because they don't have loaner.

You CAN get a loaner, if you schedule the service several weeks earlier. If it is anything urgent comes up, sorry, you have to rent a car yourself.

The problems are:
1. They want to cut loaner cost by having less loaners,
2. The MB cars have too many problems, people are busy bringing in their cars to get fixed.

I hope I haven't bought this car!

I am thinking about selling this car before the warranty expires. I just can't afford the time, the money and the patience. I just can't!

Finally, a funny thing, when I was at the dealer

part of the reason they could survive those early years was the lack of competition and the unique circumstance of having oil price rise suddenly.

those 2 pre conditions for survival no longer exists.

as to hyundai = below average reliability, i think thats fairly well accepted and what most people think. very few people will actually accpet that hyundai have japanese car reliability until they really start to see 10 year old hyundais still trouble free and on our roads.

that may yet happen, but not for another 10 years or so. may be longer.

in the meanwhile, will hyundai run out of money ?"

Thier repuation is much improved and with US and japanse investements in Huyundia they will only get better.

2010,saugatak,"April 22, 2004 5:06AM","S. Korea's credit ratings had little to do with N. Korea. Their problem was that they tied up too much capital in unproductive conglomerates whose ROI was awful because they were not run by real businessmen, but well connected people who were able to obtain interest free government loans and guarantees, which basically encouraged rampant overexpansion and covered up their mistakes.

For example, the South Korean domestic car industry is large enough to support only 1, maybe 2 domestic manufacturers. Instead, S. Korea had Hyundai, Kia, Daewoo and for a brief time, Samsung.

It is insane that Korea had 4 major manufacturers when Germany can support only 2 and the U.S. had 3 (until recently).

Now that Hyundai is the only major car manufacturer in Korea and doesn't have to worry about insane competition in its home market, they can focus on building better product.

Personally, I can't see Hyundai entering the luxury market until they can compete on a level playing field with Toyota, Honda and Nissan in terms of quality and reputation. When the big 3 of Japan made their move into luxury, what made it possible was the fact that they had cemented their reputations as building solid, reliable cars. Until Hyundai acquires that bulletproof rep, I can't see people associating Hyundai with that luxury brand image.

OTOH, if Hyundai keeps up the good work, it won't necessarily take long. Look how fast Ghosn turned around Nissan/Infinit."

Back in 1986, Honda did not exactly have a bulletproof reputation nor could most people associate Honda with a luxury brand image. Yet, they did the unthinkable and launched a luxury car brand...Acura. Five years later in 1991, the Legend Coupe won Motor Trend's prestigious Import Car of the Year trophy. The same year, the Integra took the laurels as one of Car & Driver's Ten Best. The Integra would continue to make the Ten Best list in four of the next ten years.

But there are several factors working against that.

First, the competition now is much more intense than ever before. Cadillac is producing nice cars, Chrysler is coming out with interesting product, the [non-permissible content removed]. big 3 are in the game now, and though MB and BMW have stumbled, they're still major players.

What worked back then won't necessarily work now.

Second, I don't know Hyundai's cash situation, but I don't think it's as good as Honda or Toyota when they launched their luxury brands.

In any case, I don't think Hyundai belongs in this thread since they are not yet considered luxury.

Hopefully Hyundai will follow the path of the Japanese. More quality cars, choices and competition can only benefit consumers.

What will be interesting is what happens when the Chinese come up with their own car brands and start entering the world market."

Now to true Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans

Here is the Hirsch Aero Stuff

http://www.saab-performance.com/

SAAB 9-5 AERO TAKES OFF WITH A HIRSCH PERFORMANCE PACKAGE

Already known for its responsive performance, contemporary design and world-class safety, the sporty Saab 9-5 Aero gets a bit more extreme with the introduction of the Saab Performance by Hirsch enhancement package.

Saab's Hirsch package for the 9-5 Aero gives the growing number of enthusiast customers a chance to express their individuality with significant engine and chassis upgrades and sporty styling treatments for the interior and exterior. Customers can mix and match options, as desired.

The Saab Performance by Hirsch package upgrades the Trionic engine control module, turbocharger, intercooler and intake pipes to provide a 22 percent horsepower boost to the Saab 9-5 Aero's 2.3-liter turbo engine - from 250 to 305 hp. The torque also rises, from 258 to 309 lbs.-ft. These numbers would provide the Saab 9-5 Aero with 133 horsepower per liter of displacement - a feat unmatched not only by other luxury sports sedans and wagons, but also unmatched by most sports cars.

Other enhancements include a full sports exhaust system, including dual tailpipes, performance brakes, a lowered chassis with sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch alloy wheels.

Bystanders will know something other than the standard 9-5 Aero passed them when they see the sports mesh grille insert, front bumper assembly with integrated spoiler and unique contoured rear bumper that come with the Hirsch package. Plus, the 9-5 SportWagon gets a spoiler on the rear bridge, while the sedan gets a trunk-mounted lip spoiler.

Inside, the Hirsch package offers sports leather trim for the seats and door inserts, brushed aluminum door handles, aluminum pedals, sport steering wheel and a unique finish for the main fascia, including the information and audio displays.

The Saab Performance by Hirsch package for the 9-5 Aero is the result of the long-term agreement between Saab Automobile AB and Hirsch Performance AG, the Swiss company with extensive experience in customizing Saab cars.

Saab Performance by Hirsch products are fully guaranteed by Saab and Hirsch.

HIRSCH PERFORMANCE PACKAGE FOR THE SAAB 9-5:
Upgrades of Trionic ECM, turbocharger, intercooler, intake pipe
Horsepower boosted to 305 bhp max
Torque increased to 309 lbs.-ft.
Sports exhaust with dual pipes
Performance brakes
Lowered chassis with sports-tuned suspension
18-inch alloy wheels
Sports mesh grille insert
New front bumper assembly with integrated spoiler
Contoured rear bumper assembly with sculpted side sill extensions
Roof-mounted rear bridge spoiler (wagon) or trunk-mounted lip spoiler (sedan)
Sports leather interior, including seats and door inserts
New interior fascia finish, including information and audio display
Brushed aluminum interior door handles
Aluminum pedals
Sports steering wheel

Boys & Girls I love the TL and the Infiniti but at extra legal speeds I would rather be in a Saab Aero."
2019,saugatak,"April 22, 2004 7:17PM","Kicking the old RL is a cheapshot . . . nobody defends the old RL, but the new RL looks pretty nice and if it's SH-AWD works as advertised, with the 300 HP v6 (best in class aside from insanely priced M3 and M5), I think the new RL will do pretty well and probably raise the prestige of the Acura brand.

Until Acura incorporates SH-AWD into their entire lineup, they're going to be considered a tweener brand b/c, like it or not, luxury is now associated with RWD or AWD. Some claim a v8 is necessary for lux as well, but I don't agree with that because very few people elect v8s for their sedans, even when available. I would, however, like to see Acura incorporate a V8 (or IMA or other torque boosting tech.) in their SUVs which are in serious need of a low end torque boost

However, there's nothing wrong with tweener luxury brands. I think it's great that you can get a TL or G35 for approx. $20k less than the equivalent BMW or MB (I'm comparing 5 and C class here, not 3 series b/c it's just too small).

I know there are fans of Acura and Infiniti who are annoyed with the MB/BMW/Lexus snobbery, but honestly, is it really a good thing for the consumer if both Acura and Infiniti climb up the prestige ladder a la Lexus? What do I get out of that? The right to pay more for the same car? The feeling of superiority from the badge?

Frankly, I'm hoping that Acura and Infiniti continue to produce quality vehicles yet remain tweener brands.

I just bought a G35 sedan w/6 speed. Took it through upstate NY this past weekend. Beautiful drive up around the Finger Lakes, Auburn and Skaneteles (sp?) area. Great roads, I highly recommend if you&#146;re within a few hours check the area out. On to my new car....

This car is quick. The broad torque and power curve give it tremendous flexibility. I was able to pass comfortably in 6th gear starting around 40 mph. Most other cars I've owned would have required some downshifting.

When they say the 6 speed is close ratio they weren't kidding. My shifts generally resulted in only about 1-1.5K reduction in RPM's through most of the gears. I found myself starting off in 2nd, going to 4th, then on to 6th. Unless I wanted to rip.....

And rip it does. Around corners its very stable and predictable. I knew exactly what the car was doing; direct link to the driver. The Bridgestone Turanza all seasons leave a bit to be desired, but what all-season doesn't?

The highway ride is good for a sporty car. I would put it on par with my previous 2000 BMW 323 w/sport suspension. It was slightly more crusty than my previous 2003 Accord EX V6. NVH levels fit somewhere between the two mentioned cars. The seats favor a narrow backside. Glad I fit. Like a glove. HVAC is not intuitive but once set keeps constant temps. Cruise control also requires a bit more button punching than other vehicles I've had, but, again, once set it's steady eddie.

No complaints from the back seat occupants. In fact, my son remarked on the large sunroof opening that extends back far enough for back seat occupants to enjoy a bit of the view. His center armrest was also put to good use for gameboys, food, drinks, etc.

I really like the size of this vehicle as well. Slightly larger than my old BMW 3 series, IS300's, Mercedes C class and about the same size as the 5 series. Did I mention that in black the G35 sedan looks pretty darn good?

Regarding the GM transmission, it is/was not your run of the mill unit as is available here in the U.S. on any old GM car. This unit was built in a French factory and was not used for any cars sold in American except for maybe the now defunct Catera.

The TL is selling well because it is currently fitting the priorities of more buyers with $30-40 K to spend on a performance sedan than the others. Yes, a big part of that is subjective (new model/styling, buzz from good reviews) but when you take a bunch of cars that all perform great, its the subjective stuff that makes the difference.

I bought the TL because it performs great, I never had a problem with torque steer (for the information of those overly attached to RWD) and in the end the styling and technology (love the bluetooth) were better than the rest. Especially for the $.

I think the TL owners can refute that. There's no comparing 5.1 sound to 2 channel stereo. It's like the leap from black and white to color TV. Really it's just richer and filled with more detail but the same basic message is there.

Heck, I'd love to have a DTS system in a car as the moment I see that acronym on DVD I'm excited. The sound is much crisper than Dolby 5.1.

Meanwhile, MP3s (any any other lossy or lossless codecs) will give you the convenience of having your entire library at once.

That's convenient. Yep. Given the choice between stellar sound and quanity, I'll always choose quality.

Music reproduction is not about being in the center of it. Having played orchestral brass for many years you do not want to sit in the center of music. I dont think you would care either for the way a rock band sounds from between the singer and the drum kit. Music reproduction is about creating a sound stage that accurately reflects the original true source. When you go to the concert whether it is classical or rock the sound starts in front of you. There are no speakers at the rear. Room dynamics will bounce sound all over the place and these diffractions generally speaking should be avoided. 5.1 is what Hollywood uses and for that purpose (movies) it probably is best. Top Gun with the planes flying front to back is best created by 5.1, 5.2 or what are they now talking about 6.2 with a speaker overhead or something. It is a fact that DVD-A sounds much better than CD so from that standpoint the Acura has a big advantage. We may see some manufacture going for the better still SACD but I have not heard anything yet. If any of you are ever in Las Vegas in January they have the annual audiophile manufactures convention. They have dozens of rooms with some systems costing upwards of $100,000.

First you are comparing it with a coupe G35 and everybody knows that the coupes are (i) priced higher (ii) considered more rare and thus unlikely to get any discounts. Since the acura is a sedan, you should compare with the g35 sedan. On top of everything you are comparing with the g35 manual transmission coupe which is the rarest and highest performing g35 version. It is harder to get discounts on that car ... usually each dealership only has one of them and is not worried about being able to sell it.

Also you obviously preferred the accura which means you did not bargin for a better price for the infiniti.

If you compare a G35 sedan with a TL sedan the bargained for prices should be about the same.

I would still recomend the TL for laydi because it seems that she prefers features rather than performance and the TL does seem to have a couple of more features, such as voice recognition on the navigation, bluetooth, etc."

Sport package (she could care less, but does like the seats), HK stereo (she never cranks it), Xenons... I also bought M68s off a 330i, so I could keep the winter tires on her stock style 96s. Unfortunately, she doesn't drive a stick, but it is her car after all.

So, I keep driving my Honda, and play with hers on the weekend.

2119,fedlawman,"May 11, 2004 1:06AM","This topic has played itself out pretty well but, some new iron is on the horizon that might shake up this class.

I'm speaking of the 2004.5 Volvo S40 T5 and more significantly, the upcoming 2005 Subaru Legacy 2.5GT Limited.

http://www.need-desire.com/main.html

These two cars are knoking on the door of this segment. Will they be admitted to the club?"
2120,darnac,"May 11, 2004 1:29AM",I think the Volvo may be closer than the Subaru. I am very interested in the new Legacy but it is more sport than luxury and may not even be near luxury. No steering wheel audio controls. I know the IS300 does not either. Early rumours were the Legacy would not have a remote trunk release. The ride on the GT is going to be firmer than luxury. The GT has a bunch of quality thrown at it but they did not try to hard to convey an image of luxury. They are most certainly going for the sport crowd with 250 lb/ft of torque and lightened body panels. The GT may be my next car but I am getting it for the driving dynamics and not the cush. I currently drive an 02 MB C240 which is slow but very quiet and has near luxury features.
2121,cwbarrett,"May 11, 2004 2:03AM",I have a 2002 Altima and ready to trade up. After reading these boards I took a 330IX stick for a test drive today and I don't understand all the praise. A stiff ride (all 330 have sport suspension acording to the sales guy) like that may be good for the track but it beats you up on New England roads. Yes the handling was tight but I didn't feel a strong connection with the road. The shifting was not overly smooth and it had the pickup of a 2001 Maxima. I felt the interior was very plain. I was really disappointed.
2122,shipo,"May 11, 2004 2:42AM","First, a correction; not all 330 sedans have the sport suspension. The 330i has the sport suspension; the 330xi has the standard suspension.

Relative to the ""stiff ride"", I guess it's all a matter of personal taste. The suspension on the 330xi that you drove is the exact same suspension that I had on my 1999 328i, and if anything, it was too soft. As such, I ordered the Sport Package on my next BMW, and once again, if anything, it's too soft. Oh, and by the way, I live in New England.

Regarding not feeling connected to the road, well, with the standard 205/50 R17 All-Season tires that the ""xi"" comes with, I'm not too surprised. If you want to feel connected to the road, drive a 330i with the Sport Package (SP) or better yet, drive the 330i with the Performance Package (ZHP). FWIW, the SP will only make a marginal compromise in the ride of the car while improving the handling considerably. The ZHP will magnify that compromise/improvement considerably more.

Regarding the interior, yes, BMWs do typically have simple and very functional interiors, some of us like them, some folks don't. The good news is that there is plenty of competition in that segment these days and you won't have to look too much further a field to find something that suits you better.

As for ""what's all the fuss"" it can be hard to spot. The value added quotient for BMW's lies in the details. It takes a sharp eye to spot some of the over-engineering that goes into most BMW's. From great paint that will last the life of the car to premium tires on many of the sport models, and seats that are an ergonomic marvel, it all adds up.

Go ahead snub your nose. Even the Porsche crowd is fuming that STi and Evo performance is comparable to a 911 Carrera. And the STi can beat the M3.

I can live with boring, but ugly crosses over my tolerance threshold. Am watching TL and RL closely. The styling is clean-cut and SH-AWD has my attention. But that's in the sedan category.

Sports cars are another story. For instance, I would never buy a yellow sedan, but it works on the two seaters. So do orange, purple and chartreuse.

I am also a fan of the kiddie cars aka boy racers. I know some people loathe them but I think they show energy and youthful panache. Wouldn't mind doin' up an M3 (the ultimate kiddie car) in purple with yellow and orange flames! Make that an E39 M5!!! Love ridiculous street cars.

He got a 14.7 @ 94 in the 1/4 at 59 degrees with 39% humidity. He has a 6 speed and lauched rather well. I have an auto and ran a 14.2 at 97+. Other Sedan auto's were running 15's and even a 16.

As for the Saabs yes that is a great mod car if you dont mind cranking up the turbo boost - same with Audi 1.8's...but who wants to buy a new turbo...Talking to a n/a freak here."
2182,fjm1,"May 24, 2004 5:01PM","Uh oh, self proclaimed member of the 300 hp club! ;-) Kidding aside, thanks for the info.

I don't want to speak for Dave but I think the point was that just a plenum is not going to get a G35 sedan owner 40HP (260 vs 300). I'd be skeptical that your setup is at 300. Close maybe, but the VQ ain't like uncorking some V8 where minor bolt-ons yield staggering #'s.

I would say that 10-15 whp is a reasonable claim. Won't catch me tinkering under the hood until the warranty expires. 260 hp is still plenty fast for me."
2183,chrisboth,"May 24, 2004 5:42PM","I have no idea what my HP is but I doubt the plenum is worth 40 too! How about 20 is what we G guys expect. That plus the pulley plus a modified air intake and a grounding kit is what gets you to about 300 or so. Hell the 350'Z weight in about 300 less than my car - they run about 14.4 stock auto with 287 hp so what does a faster heavier car have on the same track same day...your guess is as good as mine but If I were betting I'd say more than 287 baby!

PS The video of this race of me vs the G coupe left the guy holding the camera audibly gasping as I pulled on the coupe. AS my car hit second he was right there after second gear he was 5 lengths behind - and he has a six speed with 280 stock and was running a pop charger and z intake. While not good for 40 hp - this is worthwhile beyond the $ paid for it and the results dont lie - email me and i can link you to the discussions. The v-8 thing is true but don't let your past experience detract you from recognizing that if 2 cylinders of the six are choked for air as they are stock, that the modification will help in a significant way...again - this is not a tin can toy for a tiburon - this is an engine design mod!"
2184,speedracer3,"May 24, 2004 6:14PM","I am assuming that by doing the mod, you have essentially voided your powertrain warranty, right?...or is this something that Nissan endorses?"
2185,kdshapiro,"May 24, 2004 6:23PM",I do not believe one can make this type change and not void the warranty.
2186,chrisboth,"May 24, 2004 6:41PM","Endorsing is a far cry from denying warranty service. They don't need to endorse it to be legally inclined to fix my car if something breaks and that specific mods didn't cause the problem.

I've been down a long winding road of discovery since I bought this thing and I felt the same way as you about modding before. Hell, i've owned 5 japanse cars and until now the biggst mod I ever made was putting in speakers that didn't suck...I am not into stickers or racing on the street or being seen and heard - it's about engineering, design funtionality and making the 35k I paid for my car pay off in tinkering and improvements that DONT hurt the car. FUN! I want to own this thing for 200k miles or 10 years which ever comes first (10 years is looking good).

Why would a BETTER air intake manifold setup hurt the car? If the intake plenum itself goes then you get a new one from Doug...and the only ones to go have been covered by him even though they were all FI induced blowouts of the plenum at the weld points - yer talking 450 hp cars here!

Given that you have effectively improved the car, lets hope you didn't drop any bolts or dirt into the intake runners... IF the day you put the plenum on the car doesn't work becasue you didn't install it correctly - you're on your own. But if you put the plenum on and there is a problem with your air flow sensor or the exhaust manifold cracks - well they would have to prove that your mod casued the problem. Casue and effect are hard for them to come up with in the most clear cut cases. The MM act is a good one to get to know. It puts the burden of proof on the dealer. Proven effective mods that dont harm the engine from reputable race teams or proven mod experts is harmless fun to me. Is there risk - sure. But a better design like a plenum that offers better airflow and less air fuel ratio differential for each cylinder (or more even distribution of the same air) is not going to casue you any problems (dont take my word for it call doug or think physics). THis is no where near the modification level of a forced induction system or something that makes the engine work hotter, faster, more...this makes it work more efficiently with the existing conditions - ala the better gas mileage.

Adding 40 hp tp this car is not going to hurt it one iota. Studying the VQ for the last few months while researching the viability of lightweight underrive crank pulley I learned that the VQ may be the most naturally balanced and most durable engine ever built with 6 holes. From the cylinder bank angle to the internal balancing to the tranny that handles 340hp in a v-8 platform from the Q...it all adds up to me no longer worrying about things that wont hurt my engine. The worst thing I ever did was a Cold air intake and I may put that back on if my girlfriend stops driving it!"
2187,speedracer3,"May 24, 2004 6:43PM","KD,
Well, if it was done with NISMO parts and done at a Nissan sanctioned facility you would be ok.

Chris,
You'd be surprised how manufacturers find any excuse to strip you of your warranty. Sometimes any mod, weather related to the warranty repair or not is enough for them to deny you warranty coverage. You shouldn't have a problem with the VQ, because it is a very sturdy engine, but just in case, be prepared to fight if you go to your Infiniti dealership for warranty repair that relates to engine or tranny."
2188,chrisboth,"May 24, 2004 6:48PM","My dealer actually installed the crank pulley for me. There has never been a case where a pulley casued a VQ motor to fail.

When i show up at the dealer the techs come running to see what I'v been working on and many are incorporating my mods into thier own maxima's and G's. Many dealers sell the pulley and many have installed the plenum (not mine). Some infiniti dealership will give you a hard time as they are not mod friendly...a hard time is easliy overcome with knowledge about your rights as a consumer. I get BS from service providers all the time about things they think they cant do. A little knowledge always overcomes ignorance and people looking for an excuse to not work or cover the warranty."
2189,chrisboth,"May 24, 2004 6:53PM",IF you put a NISMO cold air induction system on and then drive into enough water to hydrolock - you will NOT be covered. The law should be applied consistently regardless of the manufacturer. I assure you INfiniti wont take on the liablity of all the people driving in FLA during the summer rain with a CAI on NISMO or not. NISMO does not have to make the aftermarket part to make you feel better..your warrantly applies in the same manner under the same law no matter what is installed by whoever..
2190,speedracer3,"May 24, 2004 7:01PM","My point was.... that if you were installing a NISMO part at your Nissan/Infiniti dealer, you have less of a chance of getting your powertrain warranty voided. A ""foreign"" part in your engine could tempt them to blackball you."

Point being - some dealers will TRY to blackball you but the ability they have to actually deny warranty service is against them and thier wishes to make things go away if they think you will because they attribute your problem to your mods. You can walk away or you can demand your rights. The words ""Magunson Moss Act"" during one of these freindly dealer spats turns heads and get results faster than you can say ""my car goes faster than the new 300C"".

""to see that there's yet another board in which the laws of physics and thermodynamics have been repealed.""

Whose repealing physics? The plenum helps the engine based on SIMPLE physics. This is Homer level. The measured airflow for the front two cylinders is not consistent with the front two or middle two by a significant measure.

You almost got it; Engineers do not make the perfect performance car or it would have 400hp. They make a balanced daily driver out of a Z platform with all the give and take of design, functionality, $, platform selection, engine availabilty. Somehow those guys at nissan who do a pretty good job based on net income figured that if they were going to have a certain clearance under the hood of the Z, they would maximaize space using a sloping plenum. As stupid as they are they still got 287 HP out of NA v-6.

Another whopping 8% in power shouldn't be so hard to believe. 20hp is alot but it doesn't change the car. Break in is also responsible for the add;l mileage I qouted and I would attribute the plenum to a 4 mpg increase on the highway. While the bolt on outfits may not impress you (have you been to one) the fact is these guys race weekly and know more about engineering and cars and speed and motors than you'd ever believe.

There are plenty of Z cars out there running 330 hp totally N/A. This should be easily believable so to think that I can't get to 300 or so with $1500 in a G with the same platform and same motor give an intake tube and a minor exhaust difference. You guys driving LS's and 3 series and TL's may have your motor on edge cominng out of the factory - mine has 30% more to give and as they release newer versions of the G they will have add'l power as well. 330 hp in the new m45 from the same VQ3.5 is probable if not foreseeable. Tinkering is not so bad guys - 3500 members giving thorough analysis to this and many other great tweaks such as a FREE airbox mod and tons others plus the support of a hundred thousand crazy Z owners can find plenty wrong with those yucky engineers at nissan and thier crap designs. Proof is in the pudding 15.0 or 14.2. The difference measured in time equates to some horsepower measurement based on the weight of my car. I wonder what that number would be?"
2198,chrisboth,"May 25, 2004 1:07PM","1) There is no possible way a dealer will attribute a non moving part to any detontation or worst case you can dream of. It's not that hard to make a plenum if you are an expert. Don't be scared there are hundreds and thousands who taken the leap based on other poeple being the guinea pig. To be clear I run NO risk for this or any mod I have chosen in terms of dealer warranty issues - this is not a twin turbo install.

2) You dont believe it because you attribute a 40% increase in mileage to what. I say the sudden blip in mileage the day after I got the plenum speaks for itself and the 2500 others with excel spreadsheets and milage charts...sha.

What do you think better/more air does to your car - effeciency come to my mind and better gas mileage would come from that as a default. Is your denial based on the 3 series having few mods like this?

3) I increase the reliablity by doing two things a) lightening the load on my crank with a lite weight pulley and b) improving and eqaulizing the airflow distribution to all intake runners.

I've been studying the physics on these for a while. I dont proclaim power numbers for the sake of it without a dyno chart but you can see them from other's with the same exact mods on more enthusiastic car specific forums for yourself. Those 2 mnods are worht 30hp."

Better performance at the expense of gas mileage. I've never seen a mod on any car that increase performance and gas mileage at the same time. If that were the case there would be a mod that increases gas mileage thorough the roof, I'm still waiting for one of them. You must be the only one that gets better performance, more pulling power and a whoppping increase in overall gas mileage. Why do you think the Subaru 2.5 engine can get an abysmal 14mpg? Yeah, it produces and it is FA, but there is a cost. There is always a cost. While your discussion at face value sounds nice, I do not buy any of it, because there is no way to measure it, only your conjecture about your interpetation. I'm not saying don't mod the car, but I do not believe any engine mod such as you did is the holy grail and in fact will not lead to warranty problems down the line.

2200,chrisboth,"May 25, 2004 4:20PM","I wont try and convince you but i wont let other G owner be steered astray by falsities or misinformation.

MOST mods that improve performance also improve gas mileage if they relate to A/F ratio increases. If I put a plenum on my car and the air flow is better and my A/F ratio is better the effect is a more effecient car. If you suggest that I can get 4 mpg only from my dreams then perhaps once you have some expereince in modding cars lightly you can join my dream. If you haven;t modded a car you may not understand that air is your friend and air is free. It contains the O2 that powers the little pistons with the help of a detonating catalyst (petrol). The more air in the ratio the more power is extracted given a FIXED amount of fuel.

I have a hard time seeing where you miss this but look at it this way. If the A/F ratio is 10 to 1 stock and I put a mod on that gets me 12 to 1 (which most intake mods do add air!) the results are more power which = less work for the motor for the same loads and speeds = better gas milage. Most people driving modded G's are there reporting 25-29. Most stock ones are 17-23. Not scientific study but not it's rocket science either."

It is some weird stuff I'm saying but you're correct..the manufacturer is losing it and they are in disarray. The phaeton is dead on arrival, the beetle is about had it's run - what are they going to make it look like now?, the passat was a great car except for the demons that live in the electrical system and it's about a year past it's sylish life and what was that 40k W-8 POS motor that's slower than a VQ all about? Luxury brand remaking is good if your customers dont stress about getting it home very night.

In light of all this the dealer was great and the service guys were very nice and gave me loaner cars when they didn't have to and were professional, timeley and very courteous but I wish I didn't have to find out they were nice. They made the most of thier opportunity to correct the uncorrectable. Jim Wynn in Norristown PA by the way. In the words of the guy who handed me a check for all my money back less 200 bucks for mileage, ""Once they get a bug you can't kill it"". He said the 7 series is the biggest electrical nightmare in germany right now as all the cool electrical modules and miles of fiber optics and 30 way headrests make it fail at almost 2% rate.

Never german is my motto even as I represent my friends and family at the audi dealer in thier purchases...yes i love to negotiate and i buy cars for fun and free for them (thier money of course). And I still give the passat thumbs up for being the best family sedan out there for the $ - as long as you get a good one...quite a caveat but I'm surprise when I tell people about my expereince how they still want the passat...great car for them...wonder what will save them now?"

Huh? Since when does manufacturers that provide mods the G have the lock and key on plenum upgrades. Breathing easier implies more gas, not more efficiency. There is a little thing called the throttle body and cylinder design that also contributes to the overall fuel efficency.

But we are way off topic here and talking about misinformation, I would like an Infiniti dealer to come on by to this forum and say there is no warranty issue, and that mods such as yours increase performance, average gas mileage, efficiency and reliability as you claim.

Lock and key on what? If you can weld you can do this but theres no point on a BMW - the plenum is not sloped in the front! Hell the plenum design is completely different on a straigh six. You can add a hood scoop ram air deal like my dads duster had - go for it. Only this car [G] as I am aware would benefit from a plenum change. Most cars already have a level plenum! So i guess we do have a lock and key...

The throttle body is fine and so is the cylinder size and design...what are you talking about. Those things work well even with a choking plenum!

No infiniti dealer will ever condone aftermarket mods. They usually are too ignorant to understand that they have to fix the car unless they can prove the mod created the problem ...You want the answer? Speak to my lemon attorney who deals in warranty cases on the side. You have more rights than you give yourself credit for.

The consumer shouldn't be held down by the ignorant whims of a unknowledgable service rep or tech or dealers. The ones I talk to will say hey great mod but not in front of thier anti-mod manager. Obviously if a dealer comes out and says mod all you want, he'll be dealing with idoits who botch thier installs and act like nothing was even touched by them let alone modded....

It's cut and dry in form but dealers will try and manhandle you. AS with most others that try to screw me out of my money they will lose. If you do want to talk to a dealer who is mod ornery Grubbs Infiniti acctually builds race cars and test cars and offer a full service tuner shop where you can buy NISMO and a host of aftermarket products intalled by them. Don't be fooled by the never been there's. My dealer never saw mods until I and subsequently a few others brought in modded G's last year. They have been educated and will continue to be as long as the trend for getting that easily obtained 300 hp is around.

I used to be skeptical too. When I asked these questions the anwers were there for the plucking. The anti mod attitude takes a while to get over and then you see the light. Maybe you should buy an infiniti now that you know all this great stuff!"

Your case may be different but when you actually have a leg to stand on such as a lemon law.. and an attorney - things start to get way easier in my experience.

I actaully told VWOA i simply wanted a warranty that would keep me happy in the car after the 2/24000 was up and free from unlimitied repair costs for a young car. They laughed and told me flat out no...they want you to go away and or get an attorney - they dont want to deal with an unhappy consumer. The frim I used has pre-litigation programs with VW where they settle 20 cars at a time....but they cant give me an extended warranty. It never even occurred to me to sue them until she laughed at me!
I had a such a good set of fact in my favor the attorney i hired told me in 15 minutes I would win and the next I heard VWOA was back on the phone asking how i would like the buy back guy to obtain my car in exchange for a check.

To the point that the designers are stupid: Look all the G had to have was enough HP to dethrone a couple of stlawart sedans from the top of the hill. If it gets better HP or equal for that matter to the class contenders, what's the problem. I would bet that 3.0 in your car has some more power stashed in there..it's a function of exterior design in the Z /G case...money is probably a bigger one. Hell we could put forged internals in all the cars and bigger cams...at some point the marketers take over and say lets build the car with x horsepower and y looks and z price. If it sells then the slanted plenum is not such a big deal...except to those of us who want the power and dont have the slanted hood of the Z. Turn out it fits in the Z too if you take out the hood liner!

No engine sold today has all the perfect design attributes...they are all filled with trade offs unless you get exotic. This trade off was a sloped hood for 20 HP. And it's a good move obviously since they sell Z's like candy and the engine does pretty well gettting them 1320 feet in 13.5 stock.

You are living proof that getting more juice out of the VQ can be done inexpensively in the aftermarket world as well. As we discussed, the risk is being denied warranty service if something goes wrong. Solution is either have 1)A good dealer 2) A good mechanic.

As to your rant about why companies don't give you the maximum potential in your engine, go figure. My Audi 1.8T with the right chip program can generate 200hp. Why do they give a measly 170hp?..my thought, so they don't trounce their V6s."

2237,jazevedo,"June 9, 2004 9:37PM","Hi, I don't want to discuss which car is better, but basically I like the 330i with zhp a bit better than the G35 due to interior and exterior looks(in a big way actually). Of course the 6K or 7K difference can help the G35 seem like the way to go. Since I really want the bmw, I need to rationalize paying the extra money.....so can anyone help me estimate the maintenance costs on the G35 during the first 4 years - I want to add that to the price of the G35 to compare to the BMW which includes maintenance. Can I assume it is close to $2K, or will it be cheaper?

If $2K, that would bring the prices within $5K of each other...still a big difference...but then again if the resale value of the BMW after 4 or 5 years is $4 or $5K above the resale value of the Infiniti....the cost to own either car would be about the same (except sales tax would be slightly higher on the bmw and interest on the higher loan)? Am I reaching here? Maybe I'm wrong to assume the Infiniti will lose as much $ value as the bmw over the 4-5 year period...I'm just guessing this because bmw's are so popular, I'd think it would be easier to sell. Any comments would be appreciated."

I'm estimating a lot of this. I do know the BMW has a $2400 dealer incentive, so $5K off sticker is achievable.. I haven't been following pricing on the G35, so that may be too generous a discount, or not generous enough.. I estimated both cars to be worth 50% of MSRP in 4 years, assuming 48K miles. That is probably a little generous for both, but it gives you a baseline. If you assume the BMW will have a little better resale, percentagewise, then it gets the numbers closer.

I was convinced it would be my next car. I drove everything under the sun BUT a manual 330i. They were tough to get my hands on between march and may of 2003.

The G35 with the 6 was great. Fantastic. But yet it didn't quite feel perfect for me. then I drove a 330ci with manual and felt I could like that car. The next day I got my hands on a 330i ZHP that was still covered in plastic. I unwrapped it like a big present, took it out for one of Cunningham BMW's excellent twisty-hilly-all road types drives. I signed for it 30 minutes later.

I knew as soon as I drove the 330i ZHP that I simply would not be happy with another car. Price be damned, you only live once.

If you can negotiate it in your area, shoot for 1900 below invoice (there's a 2400 rebate on the car). That's $500 dealer profit. Decent. Don't pay any bogus extra fees either. If you can't get that where you live but you're near the west coast - email around southern cal. There are so many dealers they're very cutthroat. My dealership did $400 over invoice in may 2003 (and still does on 3 series cars). With a rebate I would have been at 2k below invoice. Buy in so cal and just hop a southwest flight out here if you can't beat the price locally."
2241,chrisboth,"June 10, 2004 12:17PM","1200 for 4 year maintenance could be a stretch if you dont use the dealer and do some stuff yourself - air filter and cabin filter alone cost 350 or so over 4 years and you can get that to 75 or less doing it all yourself. Oil and gas is all this thing really needs and 1 good fluid change in 60k. There is little work involved in keeping a VQ running. BRakes are covered for 36k no matter what invluding rotors.

The BMW free service is not all that free as I understand it. What they give you is 15k service - basically oil and filter and they ""check everything"". My dealer is very good at this as well but they charge base service fee to check everything and change oil for 250 and all add'l labor and parts extra. FOR A 7500 mil checkup I dont need anything but oil and washer fluid thanks. BMW will need little hopelfully and less likely tho in those same intervals but you will be paying to change your oil 2 of 3 times unless you like burnt sludge on your internals. Marketing is powerful - read furhter into it. And dont forget you can mod your G save another 4 mpg add 30 hp all for 1000 bucks. 300 hp if you can turn a ratchet and 260 if not...way more fun than a 330i IMO.

LOL. The good ol' days!

""The BMW free service is not all that free as I understand it""

That is correct, they cover about 95% of the normal car maintenance. BMW will not cover tires, headliner, alignments, abuse and a few other miscellaneous items. Not sure about tranny flushes/coolant flushes. Everything else is covered in a 4 year/50K B-B warranty. Service is based on the cars service interval indicator and costs $0. They cover the fluids, microfilter, brakes/brake flush and wipers and what ever else is specified. So far in two years of ownership I've spent $0 on the car for anything. The only out of pocket was for the car alarm."

I don't think I'm far off on an Infiniti dealer charging $1200 for six maintenance visits.. every 7500 miles up to 45K. And, if the car needs brakes, the BMW comes out even further ahead, as the BMW dealer does it for free.

$2075 is still over $40/mo. more.. Not an insignificant amount, but definitely a number that you can slide by your significant other, to get the car you really want.

I tried to run all those numbers without a bias, but if I was putting hard numbers to it, I'd guess the Infiniti would depreciate more on a percentage basis, and the BMW would wear out tires faster. So, in real life, the numbers could vary a lot one way or another.

I thought the intervals BMW recommends and will pay for service on are at 15k. I hear they make you pay for 2 oil changes in between.

The depreciation of the G is the best in class of coupes and much higher residuals are offered for both versions of the G. the 54% 3 year 12k number I got is more like 61% or so now which for 3 years is awesome. I've heard 63% or 66% for coupes but not buying it unless I see it in person. These cars hold value equally well IMO. People were worried 2 years ago but resales are going very well on the G front.

PS why would BMW tires wear out faster?

And for G brakes - they can wear out every 10k as long as the rotors don't gore out IMO. These things rock like none other and grab like Governer Arnold. Pads are cheap. Especially when they are free upto 36k. My car has 20k and they have 30% left or so. Some are replacing at first oil change - brake riders I guess or LA, ATLANTA, JERSEY traffic..love the train!"

Maybe some people cringe at the thought of waiting that long, but my friends haven't had any problems and I can't imagine the dealer would recommend something that could harm the car?

I haven't researched depreciation - I just assumed the bmw would hold it's value a bit better since they appear to be more in demand - but that's just my perception and I could be wrong. I see mostly g35 coupes and not so many sedans, and the dealer seemed more willing to deal than the cocky bmw dealers (I live in San Francisco bay area).

The 330 zhp has 18 inch wheels, wheras the G35 sedan has 17's....so tires should wear out faster on the bmw...

Yes it is I dont want to hear it. There are few autos that are this fast when compared to 6sp counterparts. I drive it everyday and dont want fat left leg sydnrome from driving in philly traffic. If i wanted a true sports car with tru sports tranny for tru sports driving (on the weekend) I would look into the miata or the 2 series coming soon.

In 6MT form the G 1/4 miles are sub 14. Show me a quarter less than 14.5 for any 3 series and I'll make more sense of the comment ""For having 50+ hp on the 3 series the G35 coupe is probably only *marginally* faster in the 1/4 mile. ""

Marginally faster is still faster. 14.6 or 14.5 vs 13.9 or 14 is a major difference and worth the savings no less that a G is over a 3. Lets see marginally (+) faster and cheaper in any tranny...And don't forget if there are doubters these numbers I qoute are with 260hp. with 270 or more those margins will not get anything but bigger.

.4 seconds is a whooping at the track as the coupes i run can attest.

AS for 545 being sub 60 HA are you kidding. A loaded new 530 is 54-56k as I've shopped them and there are no discounts for a 545. The old 540 loaded was near 68 or so.

M3 for 47K - Stripped maybe and with a discount I can't get !! The 330 loaded is 44 man for 3 more K we'd all be in M3 me included. If you can get these prices please email me as I am the family car shopper and there is a demand at these numbers."

Yes, I agree if you want a G. But if you want a BMW you'll be getting substantially better gas mileage, more refined ride, better precision machine, and a nice looking ride to boot! Your ride, you decide.

If you're really talking about racing then you can supercharge your M3 and do 0-100 in 5 seconds.

2265,riez,"June 15, 2004 5:43PM","For manual transmission cars, driver skill and familiarity with the clutch & shifter will make a huge difference. The car mag guys are paid to do this and use aggressive means. Are you willing to turn your TC system off and drop your clutch at 3-5,000 RPMs and smoke your tires? Few real world drivers even come close on the street. And if they do it, they don't do it many times.

Even BMW's SMG launch control will only allow so many of the most brutal launches. Forget if the number is 5-6-7.

An automatic transmission takes most of the driver skill out of it. It is easier for the average person to get close to theoretical maximum performance since there are fewer variables and less driving skill is needed.

Don't forget that gearing and final drive ratios are critical. A huge key to best 0-60 mph time is to do it needing only 2 gears (1st and 2nd). Time between shifts is wasted. Too many cars require a shift to 3rd to hit 60 mph. They'll hit the rev limiter before reaching 60 mph and you have to upshift.

C&D's 5-60 mph ""street start"" time is probably the best single acceleration number for the average street driver!"

""Yes, I agree if you want a G. But if you want a BMW you'll be getting substantially better gas mileage, more refined ride, better precision machine, and a nice looking ride to boot! Your ride, you decide.""

1) Substantially better Gas mileage:

OK you win. Folks do report 3-6 better in a 3 over G. Got to have fuel to beat the class to tears.

2) More refined ride:

NO Is this more interior stuff because in stock 27k form the G handles better is faster than and out tractions (new term) the 330 and matches the 330 zhp. The latest test has the G sedan with 215s at .9 skidpad and most slaloms stats have the G at >66 or so and never once second to a 330 in direct comparison. There is nothing the 3 does better except maybe in ride quality? Where o where is the refinement in a vehicle that is second to the leader in all performance categories. I must have missed that when I bolted for the infiniti dealer after my 330 was 44k; and get this -no more refined than the 28K G I test drove. In fact all the extra wheel base is more 5 series like than 3 according to the bimmer loving soon to be in laws who claw at my G all weekend. The 3 is refined and it has the interior of a german car sure - but it can't run the road any better than a G beyond the intricacies of personal preference. ALWAYS subjectiveness here but lets take a look at what the media has to say once in a while when they consistently dub the G the class leader. I'm sure the new 3 will address this in spades.

3) Better precision machine:

 Um NO. What does this mean since the car is slower and handles almost as well as a G. Does the 3 have some inbred feeling of precision that makes it feel like it can handle or acccelerate like a G when it can't...whatever it is it costs too much - WAY too much.

4) Nice looking ride: YES you are correct. The 3 is great looking and will prob be the best looking of the 1-7 series once refined to Bangles desires. At least he got 1.5 of 3 right - the 5 is growing on me again! The old 3 is a classic desing for sure - i wonder if they thought they would sell that many here - ubiquity is a sign of success. The G is like the Cowboys - OK Blueguy - The G is like J LO - either people love her or hate her.

Supercharge an M3 - Power is not lacking in an M3 but that would keep me from going far from home. With all the problems a over stroked engine already has at 9k rpm - another 140 ft/# would be a detenation waiting to happen. I'm a NA guy. PS the VQ handles about 400-500 hp FI without reinforced internals. If one had to build a car from scratch and get the most HP I know pleny of FI G's that would cause one to scratch thier head when considering a M3. Guys with 6 pounds of boost are getting 12.5's with street tires. Really does anyone FI an m3? they must really turn down the boost."

 The sillier one involves top gear from like 30 or 50. Uh, what sort of a tool with a 6 speed tries to speed up in 6th from 50? That's a cruising gear - use it over 80 mph.

None of the above. I can slip into first in my bimmer and simply launch. No fuss, no TCS, nothing but zipping away. I do it quite often if I'm creeping a light I know that will change soon. Roll up, slide into first and when the light changes, slam it home.

Never had smoke coming from my tires - even with traction control off and the car going sideways.

The top gear testing data indicates engine torque and relative gearing. Just check out the difference between say a 6-speed manual TSX, a 6-speed manual G35 coupe, and a 6-speed manual GTO.


And on any of those cars, if they're geared correctly, the car should be turning almost no RPMs at 60 or 30 in 6th gear. Only an tool would attempt to punch it at 60 mph in 6th gear. You don't buy a manual to totally be out of control of the car. 3rd gear works fine at those low speeds. 6th is for over 80. Ideally around 100. top gear is supposed to be a cruising gear, not a passing gear. Sounds like the sort of test a magazine would do to compliment the lazy american style of driving."
2275,riez,"June 16, 2004 12:13PM","blueguydotcom... Remember, I'm talking about the average driver. And most drivers in USA are driving automatics. Keep in mind that many cars don't allow you to disable or fully disable their traction control system. In these cars, you can't achieve maximum acceleration launches. And other cars lack the engine output to really smoke their tires no matter how high the RPMs before you drop the clutch.

Unlike the aggressive-launch 0-60 mph test, the 5-60 mph test is a very good indicator of the average person's ability to reliably duplicate the test result, esp. in an automatic."
2276,kyfdx,"June 16, 2004 2:33PM","The 5-60 is a good test, mainly because it involves no revving up and clutch drop.

If the car is automatic, they obviously can't keep it in top gear, so the test is useless.. but, they still do it.

The TL 6MT, G35 6MT Coupe, 330ci have bland, common body styles and interiors. They are not head-turners.

2308,scott1,"June 19, 2004 4:50AM","""PS - the CTS does stand out in terms of body style.""

  I have to agree, but style is only part of the reason I went with a CTS. The Mercedes C class was too small, I drove an E320, which was a very comfortable size, and rode nice and smooth. It was also 58,000 as opposed to the 43,000 of my CTS, and didn't have the acceleration that the CTS has. What really scared me off of the E class was reading the horror stories about reliabilty over on the mercedes forum.
   I also checked out the Lexus...first the ES...a very quiet and refined car, but with no pretentions to sports car handling, and the rather blah looks of a Camry, and even the LS. The LS is a beautiful automobile, with a silky smooth engine and drivetrain, but again it's styling is rather bland,and it costs 58,000.

   The BMW 3 series was a smooth refined car,
but again, a bit cramped for my tastes .

  The CTS fit the bill best for what I was looking for. Head turning style, first class sport sedan handling, a smooth refined engine and drive train, and a quiet comfortable interior and ride. The fact that there are lots more cadillac dealers in my area then mercedes, BMW, and Lexus dealers combined, didn't hurt either."
2309,saugatak,"June 19, 2004 6:17AM","I agree with your assessment of Caddy's Art & Science theme. A little less height would make the car's proportions much better.

The Cien is a beautiful car. V12, 750HP, decent gas mileage due to DoD, what's not to like? If it makes it to production, it'll certainly spank BMW's 760i which itself is a wonderful car.

I applaud Cadillac and Nisssan for being bold and original in their styling. Even if it doesn't quite work, it's a design that can be improved on and makes a striking contrast to what is out there today.

I feel BMW tried to be bold and certain elements of Bangle's styling work well, but there seems to be no overall theme to Bangle's designs. The Bangle butt looks like it's just been slapped on. In darker colors, Bangle's front and sides look good, in lighter colors Bangle's front and sides look disproportionally large.

I also don't think Bangle was that original. The front of the new BMW's (aside from the Dame Edna turn signals) look very much like Pontiacs, except that I like the Pontiac's proportions better.

Yes, that is it. BMW does not design towards GM, GM designs toward BMW. BMWs bold and innovative designs in part are to pull away from the masses and imitators. The is no denying the heritage of these brilliant designs, but the Pontiac is the flavor of the month club.

I saw somewhere else pictures of a Sebring against a 645. I was absolutely aghast at how similiar these cars looked. It was said that BMW was copying the Sebring. Then coincidentally somem time after, I saw a 645 and Sebring in the same general location in a parking lot and it was obvious these cars share the same traits as a Ferrari with a Hyundai. Pictures do lie. In person the hertiage of a Pontiac and a 5 series are also obvious.

no, the term head-turner means you want people to notice the car. you want comments. you want to be noticed. this is the precise reason I hate owning a BMW. Like many other makes it's got a reputation - a bad one - for being driven by uppity people seeking attention.

The metal on the CTS screams, ""Pay attention to me."" As does the sheetmetal on most exotics. Many people are attacking pontiac precisely because they made the new GTO a stealth car that has no bling, that nobody watches the car pass and peers inside to see ""who is driving that?"".

Looking for a car to be a head-turner is absolutely no different than painting a Civic pink, dropping it, fitting dubs and neon lights and topping it off with a big spoiler. It's all about attention.

BTW, this is one reason I prefer the old M3. No gills. Nothing outwardly too different on the last gen M3. A debadged 03 M5 is the ultimate as it can stomp the hades out of most cars and it's pretty much nondescript.

A classic, almost by definition, is a timelessly styled car that truly performs in comparison to the other cars out there. Think of the Porsche 356 and '57 Chevy. Or the Jaguar E-type, Corvette Stingray, and Aston Martin DB6 in the 1960s. The BMW 1600/1800/2002 in 1960s and 1970s. Maybe the Fiat X19 or Porsche 914/6 in the 1970s. Audi in the 1980s. Dodge Viper in the 1990s. Or the various 911s for about 30 plus years.

There aren't that many design classics. Even normally beautiful exotic marques like Ferrari or Maserati have a ton of duds and mediocrities. (Can't say too many Italian cars after the 1960s impress me. Their exotics went down hill styling-wise in the 1970s.)

On the other hand, I feel bored, resistant and unfulfilled when I think of advancing to a class whose vehicles are bland, common and cookie-cutter in their outward appearance.

The very manufacturers of these automobiles demonstrate their recognition of the problem by their attempts to change &#150; (ref: BMW&#146;s Bangle; Cadillac&#146;s Stealth theme, etc.).

Good spot. Yeah I do remember that Opel and definitely liked it. I find it amazing how good concept cars never make it to production. I would also say the other guy is an excellent Photoshop artist. I think there is enough talent out there that is worth seeking. Then again, auto manufacturers have to work on their decision making. I have to believe they just turn chicken and perceive many concepts as too radical. And I am not convinced they are using focus groups scientifically hence effectively. It's hard to say though because they are very protective of such information.

Jazevado…
I think stealth has mostly to do with speed laws, avoiding the man. Also, there is a modesty factor&#151;being enthusiastic about performance driving without pounding one's chest, like Jason Kidd laying up instead of having to slam dunk on a breakaway. I appreciate flashy cars, but there's something tantalizingly sexy about an M5, like a gorgeous woman whose beauty can't be hidden by conservative clothing and lack of makeup.

Yeah I like the idea of debadging. It annoys me when cigar smokers leave the label on, especially the ones who smoke them routinely. Some guys just seem to wear a sign that says ""look at me I'm smoking a Cohiba."" A while back I played golf with some guy who had questionable social skills. The words came unedited, from his brain straight to his mouth. Out of no where he tells me ""take the label off your cigar"". Usually I do but I just happened to forget in a rush to get to the tee. I laughed and told him, sorry, you are very right. Actually it was a refreshing encounter. I guess there's something to be said about candor. And I never forgot to take a label off after that.

I initially thought the CTS was the ugliest thing to hit the road. While the car still isn't a classically good looking car in my book, they did nail the proportions. The only thing left to do with the next generation is to smooth out some of the harsh lines and sharp points. I don't like cars that look as though they will cut your hands if you try to feel the sheetmetal. They may have done just that (smooth out the edges/sharpness) with the 2005 STS, but the theme may not work as well on a larger car. I'll have to see the STS in person to determine that.

It is now official. I love the look of the new Chrysler 300C. I saw a few of these this past weekend. Rolling in a sea of forgettable, boring car this car really stands out. It looks like a pure gangsta car through and through. I don't know where everyone else lives, but in the Chicago area this is the hottest car on the street right now. Everyone one from older couples to young fill in the blank wannabes adore, desire and are buying this car. This is bold American styling at its best. I love it. With a SRT-8 version coming and awd, they may keep the sales going for quite a while. I don't have to tell you how bad Chrysler needed a ""hit"".

BMW. Not sure what to say here other than that they've probably ruined one of the top 5 most recognizable design languages in all of cardom. I still at 3 years later detest the 7-Series. The 5-Series is little better, especially in darker colors, but it still gets smoked by the E-Class in styling. The 6-Series if there ever was a car who's whole look was ruined by one element, that big old square [non-permissible content removed]! BMW really better ask themselves about what they want for the 2006 3-Series.

The Acura TL comes so close to being a styling star, but no cigar. Contrived and messy styling imo. That character line and those side sills don't work together. Dealers here are adding protective strips right below that charater line, creating a true mess. Factory mud flaps, yuck. Honda it seems is destined to style every 4-door car they make like some variation of an Accord. Witness the 2005 RL. Giant Accord. The TSX remains the best looking Acura, imo.

I'm slightly worried about a company that seemingly could do no wrong when it came to styling, Audi. They're going to put the new grille on everything by 2006. Not sure about that. I liked the new grille design on the A8L W12 but I've yet to see the new A6 and facelifted A4. Careful. The current A6 had no styling rival in it's class until the 2003 E appeared, imo. The 1998-2004 was just perfect in that sense to me.

Nissan is hit or miss stylistically now. The Maxima is a mess inside and out. The Murano and Quest are messes inside, either cheap or just plain weird. The Altima was good looking in 2002, but has since blended in. Nothing tops the Passat in the family segment in styling for me.

The G body work is being incorporated into the new and quite stunning M45. It's safe to say that those design lines will be with us for a while. Thank god! Like the CTS, the G35 is DIFFERENT and not like it's euro competitors. That's where opinions differ.

Couple weeks ago, my wife was driving a 9-3 on a 5-lane highway. Suddently, a construction truck changed lanes without making any signal. The truck ran into the driver side of our 9-3. The 9-3 spinned around from the right to the left. Finally, the back of the car hit the median wall and stopped.

Everyone was surprised my wife was ok at that time. The doctor from the ER asked my wife what kind of car she drove. My wife said ""A Saab"". Then the doctor said ""Oh, you should be ok. My sister-in-law got a Saab too. They are very safe"". She came home on the same day. If she were driving in a Japanese car, she probably stayed in the hospital for weeks.

Although the major damages were on the drive side doors and the trunk, the insurance company decided to write off the car (maybe it's too expensive to fix the frame).

There is no paint came off from the car (I didn't see any paint came off from the car for my 3+ years of ownership. Saab must put good paint on it, not like the Honda's).

We looked at the internet and found that most Saab owners who lost their cars in an accident ended up byuing another Saab.

Both my wife and I feel more secure in buying European cars because they perform real life crash test, not those in-house lab tests.

From BMWs perspective, they have engineered their cars to be safer in what they consider to be true ""Real World"" crashes and the NHTSA be damned.

Who is correct? I don't really know. That said; it takes some moxie to deliberately engineer a car that does not do well in the NHTSA tests. As such, I'm inclined to think that my BMW is more than safe enough.

It is no secret that BMW just recently say like in the last 10-15 years really got serious about safety, but the rest have proven their worth in real-world crashes...especially Volvo and Mercedes. They've been collecting data on their wrecked cars in real world accidents in Europe for over 40 years and you're telling us that all of this reasearch puts them on or at the same level as companies like GM or Ford in safety. These two in particular don't even know where to put gas tanks in their cars or trucks. I'd really like to see your status if a C-Class or S40 gets hit by an SUV compared to a Focus or Cavalier or Civic.

These lab tests are silly in the fact that they are controlled and very predictable. Since when is a real world accident predictable and controlled? Companies like MB and Volvo were doing safety engineering before any of these US test organizations had a clue. Amazingly now the NHTSA wants makers to address rear-end impacts and the affects it has on seats, only about 20 years after Volvo and Mercedes solved the problem. These same safey regs give American cars that have headrests (important in a rear collision) that ""rests"" in the small of your back and don't come anywhere near protecting your actual ""head"" a ""five star"" safety rating.

At the time I though, ""Wow look how safe these German cars are"" but after really looking into it I can't say the results would have been much different if we'd been in a civic or corolla. Probably different in a bimmer, as side protection is crap but other small cars seemed to fair fine in side collisions.

Buy into the marketing, that's fine. I don't for a second believe an MB or Volvo is head and shoulders safer than any other late model Japanese luxury brand.

I don't give a hoot what MB did safety wise in 1970, 80, 90. Doesn't matter to me. The cars made today by most luxury makes - BMW accepted - appear to have leveled the playing field to the point that declaring MB safer by virtue of its history just seems incredibly bias."

blueguydotcom,

My point about the Acura RL is that it failed a crash test and it supposed to be Acura's top car. Meaning that not all luxury car are created equal in terms of safety. I'm not shocked that you don't care about what Mercedes or Volvo did in the name of safety back in the day, long as you know that the car you're driving now benefited from what they did. Crumple Zone engineering didn't just fall from the sky. You're suggesting that all the research these companies did years before anyone else had clue puts them merely equal with companies that didn't even care about safety 10-15 years ago. Not even to suggest that MB or Volvo is safer because of what they did in the past. If you check into Insurance data in Europe on European cars you'll see where Volvo, Renault, Mercedes and others have proven they are safer than the majority of Japanese cars. It is well documented that Mercedes, Volvo and Porsche in particular addressed certain safety issues (like rear impacts) before Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford even began to research the problem. Now the government is going to set a standard, years and years after the hard work was done by you know who. But I'm to believe that Corolla is as safe a Volvo or Mercedes. Ok.

First the cavialiers and civics and corolla that are much smaller than the mid size sedan volvos and mercs - these cars aren't even comparable. On thier own they have some great cars at that smaller class level where it's inherently more dangerous in certain types of impact.

Second if you think real world cars aren't better because something can't be gleaned from slamming half a car into a block wall at 45 in offset fashion then you might just assume that you will only be in other more friendly kinds of accidents. There are few more tragic impacts than head on offset frontal. You need to know what happens at 45 which is a major impact before a car can become a protective shell at 65. A merc c class more safer than a G or Maxima - horse puckey

Actually seeing what happens in a controlled setting while the car rips apart up to the passengers knees and head is probably the reason G's may be safer than the volvo mercedes and 3 series. I haven't seen any reason to believe I should buy into the pioneers marketing campaigns - all safety technology has been pertty reverse engineered if not shared and everyone uses everyone elses ideas...it's why there are so many great safe cars. Buy a chrysler if that emotion stirs your decision making it was Iaccoca that demanded airbags and did major groundbreaking in his labs for the technology to come to market.

The safest cars to be in are the accords and camarys based on real data. Can someone help me remember where I read this a month or so ago? ~ It may have been related to recent press about the rollover ratings, I'll post if I find it The article stated that a lithe sedan is way less dangerous than any suv for rolling over which is the more deadly variety of accident. Also the drivers that buy conservative sedans may be part of the correlation. If you really want to be safe a volvo will make you feel good before the accident thanks to the marketing but I'll not feel any safer since I know my car has more ability to avoid some accidents better than any car in class thanks to its handling edge and if impact does happen I should do as well it's compeitors."

I don't really believe this, but I absolutely agree that simulating an accident is not the same as being in one.

Plenty of people have griven japanese cars into barriers at 90 and lived and plenty of volvo owners died in under 40 crashes.

For some European Manufacturers, like Volvo & Saab, they have been famous for safety (and they focus on safety a lot) for a long time. As I mentioned before, please knock on the doors on a Japanese car and then the doors on an European car (or maybe an American car too). You can tell the latter is more solid. The later usually has much more heavy doors too. Just think it simple, throw an egg and a stone (may not be that extreme but it is just an example) to the wall. Which one will have fewer damages ? I feel European cars are safety just based on my experience (I don't even want to mention the accident my mom had with her Corolla).

I think most Japanese mid-size cars are safe, but no as safe as European's. For Civic and Corolla (or Tercel/Echo), I doubt you can walk out with minor injury after a highway accident.

Basically, I think they're both be very safe - and I feel very well protected in each of them. I do, however, place a lot of value in Volvo's history of safety research, testing, and pioneering new technologies/devices (WHIPS, SIPS, etc.) Today, as in the past, Volvo devotes a great deal of it's resources into safety research, and the result is they are typically among the first to introduce groundbreaking new safety features. Other car companies adopt this technology a couple years later and all cars on the road get safer and safer year after year.

Also a C-Class or S40 are similar in size to a Corolla or Civic. I garuantee a C-Class or S40 will come out better than any other comparably sized car.

Camrys and Accord being the safest cars is the horse puckey imo. There is no way either of these are as safe as a mid-size or large Volvo or Mercedes or even a Saab 9-5. Have you seen Saab's safety tests for the 9-5 in which they meet off-set at 75mph. Honda and Toyota wouldn't dare attempt this.

""You need to know what happens at 45 which is a major impact before a car can become a protective shell at 65.""

My point exactly and why would they care about a 65 mph crash if they only have to pass the test at 45. Nissan is not a safety driven company like Volvo or Mercedes or Saab and with all the cheapining they've been doing do you really think they've thought any further about safety past government tests? I seriously doubt it. A crash at 45 mph is serious enough, but when you add another 20 mph to the game you're basically talking a whole new level of danger, with a corresponding level of engineering needed.

What's the big deal with 65 vs 45. Do you really know what's best for engineers designing cars. No. It's easy to make tests have 65 mph as national standard but most cars would be demolished - while our class would benefit the rest of the smaller 75 cars on the market would be scrap after an offset frontal at that speed.

These are the exact 2 cars I compared when I was looking for a new car. Safety was a primary concern for me along with reliability. I drove a Volvo S40 T5 exactly 2 days after the lot got its first 2004.5 S40. I like the looks of the S40 except for the Avalon type roof lines on the front and rear profile which really turns me off. It seemed to have plenty of pep for a 4 cylinder not too much turbo lag. However, I did not feel comfortable in the drivers seat. The placement of the console and the view from the drivers seat just didn't seem right for some reason. Also, the rear seat is quite uncomfortable for average passengers. I am only 6 ft tall and sitting in the back seat my head was touching the head liner and my legs were hard against the front seats.

That same day I test drove an Acura TL and my search was over. The TL felt more comfortable, solid, and faster. The interior quality was much higher IMO. The interior space on the TL is much larger that the S40. After adding all the options I wanted to the S40 I was at the same price as the TL w/o navigation which already had all those options. After 4000 miles on the TL I have absolutely no regrets.

I do not think for a second that the Volvo S40 is any safer to drive than the TL. They both ranked the same in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety frontal offset crash tests. The TL ranked in the top position for mid-sized luxury cars and the S40 was in the top position for mid-sized moderately priced cars. FYI, the Volvo S60 ranked last in the mid-sized luxury car category in this test. You can complain all you want about controlled crash testing but to this date it is the only benchmark we have."

Word is also coming that a turbo version will be around with 333 hp as the high end 330i before one jumps to an M3 with a V8.

Turbo? If it's small low pressure turbo, that'll help the torque-deficiency problem of BMW's overly praised inline 6.

I'm not knocking the G35, but Nissan has been very skimpy with their cars to get them to the market right now and there is no way I'll believe that they're just as safe as Volvo, Saab or Mercedes…these companies while they've had their problems in other areas have never compromised on safety. Now Nissan is supposed to have matched them in an area they weren't even an expert in during the time where they're cutting cost at every possible area. Right.

Skimpy my @&;^. The cars on the line right now have nissan at the height of the industry on just about every front including product quality.

Profit in an oversupplied industry is just one indication that ""rushing to market"" is hogwash. The g35 certainly wasn't rushed to market nor was the FX the Z or the upcoming M45.

Nobody said the G35 or FX were rushed to the market, but the 350Z has a cardboard interior if there ever was one in a car. It is downright worse than some GM cars in interior quality.

It does not have the handling, however in the hands of an average driver the Z is easier, in the hands of a skilled driver, the Porsche will pass the Z like a milk-truck. Street racing is not the forum to find out if any one car is faster or not.

BMW reliability is not an oxymoron. BMW is tops in a number of different ownership surveys. I will admit in defects/100 Lexus rules, but that doesn't mean BMW is unreliable.

Well, one issue is they are typically uncomfortable for me. They seem to be designed either for smaller-framed people than i. I was looking at an acura RSX, and the salesman was lauging at me trying to get comfortable in the car. I do, however, think that there is more similarity than difference between cars from the same engineering culture, and you can make (very) general statements, about control heaviness, safety(europen) vs reliability(japanese), etc. The fact is a $35K car is a $35K car, and engineers are about as good all over the world. Cars at the same price point are all about equally contented, albeit often in very different areas, and we (ought) to choose based on our wants in these areas. Instead we often succumb to magazine articles and marketing campaigns. But it's weird to me how attached people get to a marquis, shouting the strong areas and denying the compromises.

CVT is sooo smooth. No abrupt jerks as your tranny goes from one gear to the next...actually, no shifting sensation at all, just the pure rush of seemless accelaration. It takes a little to get used to it, but once you are, you think of other automatics as unrefined.

The Nissan CVT (called Xtroid) can handle massive amounts of torque. Nissan has been using CVT in mosters as the Cedric and Gloria in Japan for years. For once, Audi is way behind on this one.

The 325i outsells the 330i by almost 5 to 1. What would the 3 series sales be without the 2.5L option? Apparently, the next C will have 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 engine choices as well (thanks merc1 for this info.)

Of course, selling a G30 could hurt Infiniti's ""power image.""

You might argue that it's not good to have a G30 while ""lesser"" Nissan sedans such as the Altima and the Maxima have larger 3.5L V6s. Then... have the 3.0L option in the Altima and Maxima as well.

BMW does the same thing. They make the 525i even though the 330i exists. And the 525i sells well--almost as well as the 530i.

Increase brand awareness by catering to a wider market of buyers (by offering a G30). These buyers may also trade up as they get older. Face it, Infiniti has made great progress in the past couple years, but it still has nowhere the brand recognition of BMW, MB, or Lexus. Of course, they should also go more ""upscale"" by concentrating on the M sedan and coupe, as well as the next Q.

All the press and buzz and comparisons that BMW makes is with the 330i, yet the reality is that the 325i is their bread and butter. The G35/G30 relationship could be the same.

The stock plenum is choking the front bank of cylinders for air. A less restrictive plenum doesn't allow for more air it allows the SAME air to work more efficently by more equally sharing the airflow and distribution of that airflow. Lots of people doubt this snakeoil plenum adds any power either and thats why enthusiasts race and test and race and test and the rest of the daisy drivers wonder and live with things the way they are.

Your reading comprehension must be better than you allude with your argument. 23-25 is not bad and the math works out if you get out your calculator and concentrate.

Whatever your answer it can be applied to the fuel efficiency argument so you must believe two contradicting things...not worth the time anymore but fun during a meeting that is over...come back if you get a real car and want to learn something"
2564,dhanley,"July 7, 2004 7:12PM","That's just not how it works. In situations where the throttle is wide open, airflow is an issue. At low RPM's on highway drives, there is a high level of vacuum in the plenum already, and airflow is slow--nothing is going to get starved. Even the developers of the plenum say this. I know you unfortunately can't cope with a manual transmission, but there is a thing on the dash called a tachometer that will help you see highways RPM's.

By the way, if by getting our calculator out and concentrating you conclude that 440/20 = 23-25, then i see why we're having problems communicating.

Keep in mind that my '03 G35 coupe is used and has about 25K miles; so this could support the argument that the gas mileage gets better with age. But 26mpg is definitely surprising for a car like this. Just my .02 for what its worth.

And while you're at take some classes on engine design. Bolt ons are one thing...fundametally changing the intake is another. You babble about throttle positioning...who cares...what matters is the SAME AIR (please dont repsond until you get this) is more evenly distributed.

"" You pretty much abuse the notion that the thing helps fuel efficiency what is your explanation for 15 HP?""

I already explained that. Plenum restriction does have an impact for high RPM wide-open throttle operation. This is normal and expected. There are lots of dyno graphs that illustrate this--often airflow enhancement hurts power at lower RPM's. Counterintuitive, but that's how it works.

I found some interesting g35 dyno charts with the crawford plenum, but unfortunately i can't link to them due to town hall rules. According to them, even 15hp is optimistic. But i'm not arguing about power, just the idea that increasing airflow is going to incrase economy. It just doesn't work that way. Your engine is *SUPPOSED* to be starved when cruising on the highway. That's the point of a throttle.

A lot of people seem to assume that increasing one aspect of efficiency ( power ) is going to positively impact another aspect ( fuel economy ). They're often different issues--but not always of course--reducing internal friction would improve both. But thinking that anything that increases power is going to increase fuel economy is like thinking that anything that helps me run faster is also going to help me bench more. Not necessarily, or even often, the case.

Like most I do not go into the 5 gallon reserve. I get filled up on E and typically my fill up is about 14-15 gallons - NOT the 20 in your denominator. The plenum theory is certainly unproven but the mileage results are facts for many people. I agree with the vacuum thing and all the other talk about highway airflow needs not being great enough miss the point regarding inefficient cylinders. Starved for air is one thing...never getting what the others have ever is another. Hi rmp whatever...im always in high rmp - maybe thats why my results go against all the proposed theory. In any case Im running a faster car than a magnum 300c or a 540i...that's what I bought it for. Power and repsonse. All the mods I have performed have given me better gas mileage in incremental and distinct blips right along with additional power. Perhaps Dhahnley is right and the break in is responsible for my 47% improvement in fuel economy. Anything is possible but for those laws of physics seem to be working in my favor.

Also the substantial weight of the cars plays a role. The most engaging car on the road that I've driven is still without a doubt the Miata. Point and shoot.

I made this same point about everyone adopting this crease a little while back. Mercedes' 2005 SLK, Toyota's Sienna, Honda's Accord, Cadillac's new STS, and CTS all have it, and upcoming Mercedes and VWs will have it too, and just like you stated with varying degress of success.

2619,dhanley,"July 15, 2004 9:06PM","I had a hard time gauging how it handled. It ""felt"" very like a german car. It felt a lot like a c-class, a bit better steering, but more isolated. But the c-class i drove that day had a sport package and the CTS didn't.

2623,chrisboth,"July 16, 2004 12:25PM",there is an inverse relationship between handling and ride..this is an axiom of sports sedan performance. Oddly enough the sports package with the harder firmer ride is better to live with than the non sports which rolls and bobs. The G35 has a more planted feel than any car with 4 doors that I have driven - that's what makes the car feel luxurious to me. IF you want cush - this car is not for you...it's going to tranfer some road and uneven pavement vibration to the passenger. The enthusiast prefers it this way. Hell BMW invented it! Many people dont like the 540 sport package ride either. They have town cars for them folks...
2624,designman,"July 16, 2004 1:41PM","""Many people dont like the 540 sport package ride either. They have town cars for them folks...""

Chris, it's a matter of degree. BMW has the spectrum covered from non-sport automatic setups up to the Ms. Most people appreciate the basic tight BMW sedan ride without wanting blue-plate performance. It's a midway point between the luxury ride and the sport ride.

2627,fjm1,"July 16, 2004 2:54PM","I&#146;ve owned both a 3&#146;er sedan with sport suspension and now own a G sedan with sport suspension. I try to autocross at least once per year, finnally getting the G on the track. When I was in Germany the BMW went to Hockenheim and Nurburgring. I will say right now that the BMW has a better balance of firmness and compliance in everyday driving. But these are my on track observations.

The BMW will hit precisely on the marks lap after lap. The BMW understeers. Slow speed corners can be a challenge because the chassis must be &#147;flicked&#148; into the corner. By this I mean as you come into a slow (sub 30 mph) tight corner the balance of the BMW must be purposely upset to allow for better rotation of the nose. Normally this can be done with the throttle on most rear drivers but the BMW tucks it&#146;s tail and digs during WOT corner exit. The suspension in the BMW is better at soaking up track irregularities. Mid corner bumps don&#146;t usually cause you to run wide or have to lift for fear of rotation. BMW sport suspension handles multiple corners like S-curves very well. Threshold braking is linear with zero fade. The BMW is surgical, precise, capable and unflappable.

Having said all that about the BMW the G is ultimately more capable mostly because of more power. It takes a better driver than me to wring out everything the G has to offer. The G takes a few more course corrections. The G is easier to modulate with the throttle. The G can be coaxed to drift easier and superior torque can make for terrifying exit speeds. I can run out of track and talent with the G&#146;s go pedal. Tight corners can be dispatched easily with a touch of throttle-on oversteer. Track irregularities can upset the G&#146;s chassis during threshold braking and the rear can definitely step out on fast sweepers. The G does not transition very well during multi-corner maneuvers. There is more bobbing as the dampers fight to control pitch and roll. Once the G is set though it&#146;s time to dial in the throttle and ROCKET. The G is powerful, visceral, involved, and ultimately more rewarding to drive fast.

On a road course I believe a novice driver could drive a BMW and post better times than in a G. A skilled driver in a G would post better times than in a BMW. For me, it would probably be a wash depending on the length of the straightaway. Ultimately, I enjoy both cars greatly and am fortunate to have owned both and gotten to test each cars limits within a safe, controlled environment."
2628,blueguydotcom,"July 16, 2004 3:14PM","Blueguy… You think the Miata is cool? Now you're talkin' real sport driving. Ever drive an S2000?

I love the feel of Miatas. Like a go-kart! My family has owned at least one since 1991 so i'm pretty darn familiar with how them. Even the original with the tiny 113 hp engine was a blast.

No, I haven't driven an S2000 yet. I will do so in April-March of 2006 when I begin the quest for the Bimmer's replacement.

Someone mentioned driving long distances and the perf package as rough...actually on long freeway drives it's pretty much like a normal 330i. It's on surface streets that it feels more jittery."

I may get them even tho I don't track her on road courses. People say the rigididty over bumps is improved and the sway is nill - they are adjustable so you could also tweak the balance to oversteer from under which is stock even if the tail fliks easily.

You do give up some independence of the suspension but - what's a slightly harsher ride going to mean at this point anyway...apparently it's already like driving a non-sprung shoppping cart!"
2631,blueguydotcom,"July 16, 2004 8:15PM",That's a killer car. Too bad it's 40k+. That's a little steep for a car that's not even all-weather capable. not that it rains here...

I had driven the G35 a few months ago, but it was an automatic so I can't compare exactly. My initial reaction was that it wasn't as fast as I'd hoped. I'm used to a V8 mustang and while the BMW is quicker to 60 and 1/4 mile, I think it has more to do with the higher revving engine and more consistent engine output, whereas the V8 screams at 3500 RPM's but gives up in the higher rmps.

Anybody else think the G35's higher torque numbers make the car ""feel"" quicker? I'm wondering if I'll get bored with the bmw after a year....I must admit I wasn't used to the clutch so my shifts weren't completely smooth...maybe once I get used to the car it will feel faster? I'm not saying it felt slow, it just didn't make my hair stand up!

The handling definitely was great and I like the interior much better than the G35. And I love the looks even though BMW's are everywhere. Just curious what others think of the acceleration feel in these cars.

It never will really feel faster. some BMW lovers will claim the engine loosens up and gets freer-revving after xxxxx miles. Yeah, whatever.

2634,rsr152,"July 18, 2004 12:59PM","Hi,
I will be moving to Portland, OR and purchasing a new car in about 1.5-2 months. I had a few questions and would appreciate any pointers or suggestions. Currently I am a resident of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).

My choice is between the TL & G35 leather w/ premium pkg.(An '04 I35 w/ Nav. and cold weather pkg. for < $28k would be a third choice).

Questions:

(i) What are typical ""additional"" fees dealers charge in Oregon, or to Oregon residents (buying in WA, or CA, for instance)?

(ii) There is no sales tax on cars, right, for OR residents?

(iii) What is a good time to buy a new car- August, September, October (due to '05 models and inventory reduction etc.)?

(iv) Would it be unreasonable to expect to get an '04 non- navi. TL or '04 G35 leather w/ prem. pkg. for $32k, all inclusive?

(v) How well does the argument of an '04 car being ""a year old"" (and so it should be offered for lesser) usually work in Aug/ Sept/ Oct, if the dealer has some '04 models on-site?

Thanks again."

I see you're asking these questions in a few places, but you might have missed the best place for most of them. Check out our Smart Shopper board. That's the main place where the most of the issues you raise are best addressed.

Meanwhile, the G35 vs. TL discussion you found is a great place to learn what folks thinks about how the features of each compare.

Do take a look at the discussions on the SS board - I'm sure you can find answers to most of these questions that you've posted here and in the other two discussions.

yes, its true theres NO sales tax for OR residents. and depending on the area, '05 models usually hit the dealerships around early Sept here (im in WA)
im not sure about the G35's price but as far as i know getting a TL for $32k is reasonable, while imo you can actually go a little lower once the '05s are on the lot. i almost bought a TL myself, heck it was hard to negotiate back then since there were only a few units in the inventory and lots of buyers.
no i dont think you can really consider a new '04 as a 1 yr old used, but you can get some nice deals out of it, id say you can get bout $1000-2000 off the price.
note that some dealers just want to get the ""older"" cars off the inventory, thats where you can get some nice deals"

I looked today at a 2002 MB C320 Sedan. It looks like I could get it for around $25K which seems to be a dang good price, based on what I got from NADA. (Based on the VIN, they had it booked at $29,625 - Retail - and $25,775 - Trade-In.) Before I do anything nuts, I thought I'd ask a few questions . . .

1. The car has 27,000 miles on it, so it still has a ways to go on the warranty. Anyone have any experience with MB dealerships on how willing they are are to honor warranty issues from second or third owners of the vehicle?

2. There seem to be lots of questions about quality on this board. I know it's annoying when a quality vehicle gives you grief but it also sounds like the vehicles under warranty are getting problems fixed without too much trouble. Am I right or am I missing something?

3. I gotta know more about the cell phone thing. My guess is that it will only work with a specific MB approved, cell phone provider, right? There's no way to get my US Cellular number to work with this thing is there?

4. Any other advice from those of you who have bought a used MB C-Class vehicle?

Thanks for your help!

2645,bmbmw,"August 6, 2004 12:33AM","Greetings all... I have been following this board for over a year and have found the discussions both interesting and insightful. This fall I intend to purchase either a new ('05) 240 (elegance) or BMW 325i. I have only owned and driven Corolla's in the past, on average keeping them 12 years...they have only ever been great cars. In terms of reliability, they are my standard. But I'm ready to try something more upscale now and after a fair amount of research it has come down to the 2 fine cars mentioned above. I intend to keep my next car for 10 years, I will only put low(city) mileage on it, will get the extended warranty and expect to pay it off within 1 year.

 My first choice (or the choice of my heart) would be the 240, but I am concerned about the recent Consumer Reports ratings of the car. I know that the 01 and 02 years are of greater concern on this. How has the reliability been for those who bought '03 and '04 model years?

 I guess my close 2nd choice (or the choice of my head) would be the BMW... its a little more sports sedan (I'm more of a touring sedan type myself)and it has very high ratings from most automotive sources... at any rate I would appreciate your thoughts, thank you...

i've heard of quite a number of people complaining about the pre-'04 C-class' seats, being uncomfy on longer trips. but i heard they fixed it since the '04 model.
reliability isnt far from bmw's, which in this case, if you drive only [non-permissible content removed] cars so far, is gonna be a pain in the butt if you wanna keep it for 10 years.
but even if youre more into touring the bmw is still a fine choice just a bit less comfy than the mercedes in the ride department

The reality of it is that the vast majority of cars out there, and probably all the ones in this topic, are within a statistical deviation of each other, so just buy what you like and gets you the most bang for your buck.

2649,kyfdx,"August 6, 2004 2:15PM","From anecdotal evidence I would say the BMW will be cheaper to maintain than the Mercedes. If you keep it for ten years, resale isn't that important, but if you do happen to get rid of it earlier, the 3-series will hold its value better than the C-class.

Something that might sway you.. BMW will soon be offering manufacturer extended warranties that bump the coverage to 6yr/100K miles and you can also extend the ""free"" maintenance coverage to match that time period. The extended warranty is $2249 and the extended maintenance plan is $995.

Except for future price increases, you can buy that coverage for the same price at any time before your original warranty and maintenance plan run out.

I wouldn't discount the BMW, just because you are a ""touring"" type of person.. Just stay away from the sport package. One of the 3-series strengths is how well it combines handling with a good ride.

2650,oneandonly1,"August 6, 2004 10:09PM","I purchased a 2002 C320 in December 2003, and also got a great deal. Paid about $28k, and this one was fully loaded with the CD changer, phone cradle, heated seats, etc. Best things was it only had 10k miles on it, couldn't believe it.

1. Service with Mercedes Benz has been great. The car is still under warranty, and coverage has never been an issue even though I am not the original owner. I have 20k miles on it now, and still have till 2006 or 34k more miles to go to the warranty. And regular maintenance/oil changes/tire rotation are all free!!

2. I have taken the car in for a a few things and they have gone above and beyond: the cupolder has chrome button marked ""push"" that was chipping, so they replaced it; instrument had a smudle so they replaced it; spare tire cover plastic handle was broke so they replaced it. Only problem I have had is there was a whining noise when I would make a turn, and turns out it was the power steering. They replaced the power steering pump. Best thing is they also give you a free rental car while your car is being serviced.

3. I have the phone cradle for a Motorola V60. I was thrilled when I got the car because I already had a V60. But then I found out that it has to be a Mercedes Benz V60. You know, its a contract between MB and Motorola so they have to get you somehow. I found the phone on ebay for about $200 and its been worth every penny. I have service through Verizon, and live in CA. Love being able to answer the phone handsfree through the radio speakers, and dial through the number pad on the radio.

4. Bottom line, I love the car. Had it for 7 months now and don't regret buying it. What I can recommend is that while its under warranty, take advantage of fixing any problem no matter how small. I've always driven Hondas or Nissans, but this car is a lot of luxury in a compact affordable package."

I've already had a great experience with MB customer service. I called our local dealership to ask a couple of questions - including whether or not they might be able to provide me with information about the service record. Not only were they willing to do that (even though I wouldn't be buying the car from them) but they faxed it over to me! Although there have been about a dozen things done to the car over the last year, all were done under warranty and all but one were more cosmetic than anything else. The one thing that looked kinda major was something labeled ""Rubber Mount, Torsion Bar.""

To make a long story short, and after a LOT of haggling, I ended up buying this car for $27,500 + tax. I test drove this car the same day as the TL, and I honestly loved both cars equally. Apples and oranges. I couldn't justify spending the extra $2,500 (minimum) to get the TL. In other words, the TL didn't blow me away to the point where I was saying ""This is the car I MUST own..."" I am on a tight budget, so this figure was ideally the amount that I wanted to spend on a car. Yes it is an '03, not an '04, but at that price I couldn't turn it down.

Will pick up the car this Monday (August 6) and I hope this will be the beginning of a new long and fruitful relationship with Saab.

I drove a Lexus GS430, M-B S430, Infiniti G35, Lexus IS300, BMW 330i, Lexus LS430, Acura TL, Lexus ES330.

Impressions?

GS430 - good power and good handling, nice but outdated interior layout/design (CD changer in glovebox, poorly designed center console/storage, etc.). This car needs to be re-styled, inside and out.

S430 - nice power and surprisingly good handling for such a large car(this car really attacked the corners!). Interior was high class, but somewhat cold/uninviting with some quirky ergonomics.

G35 - best drive of the bunch! Brakes very grabby (took some finesse), but wonderful power, exhaust note, and cornering. Interior layout/quality is this cars Achilles heel (it was a 2004).

IS300 - not as hard edged as I remember. Light and nimble handling, decent power, yet at a disadvantage vs. competition. Interior looked and felt cramped, uninviting, and low-rent (well, my wife liked the speedometer).

330i - More powerful than IS300, but softer around the edges handling and drivetrain wise (slightly more ""mush"" in the steering, suspension, and throttle response. Interior a step or two up from IS300 and G35, but still looked and felt dated and a little cheap.

LS430 - The car I'd choose if I had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips. Plush, warm and inviting interior (suede headliner, big comfy seats, everything soft-touch). Nice straight-line power, but a pig in the twisties.

TL - The car I'd choose if I had to commute in traffic or took a lot of trips, but only had $30K to spend. Basically felt like a lower-rent LS430...nice power and plush modern interior, but soft driving dynamics.

ES330 - My wife drove this one. She liked it, I didn't. A Camry dressed in Lexus clothing.

Conclusions? If someone could build a $30K ish car that drives/sounds like the G35, and has the interior of the TL, they'd get my money.

I live in Colorado and need to know if there are any other Coloradans or people that have driven I-70 over Eisenhower tunnel in a 325i loaded with people (10,000 ft up). I used to have a Honda Prelude w/ a power to weight ratio of 1hp to 19.3 lbs. and the 325i has a 16.3 power to weight. I would be luggin' extra weight due to 4 people. The Honda did just fine if you dipped into the power band a little bit. The Honda was geared a little on the high side like the 325i (relative to their respective competitors). I'd like to buy new and the 325i is the most I can afford. (Mention a new 330 and just break out the drool cup...:) I'm looking at this being a 100k car; that's why I am not looking at a used 330i.

A friend has the has the new TL, you know what he raves about, the bluetooth phone and the DVD-a. I didn't hear one word about the cars handling.

2677,fedlawman,"August 17, 2004 1:29AM","Re: my wife. Yes, she basically agreed, though she has less time invested (and interest) in closely examining the finer details of a car. She warms to a car that is handsome, comfortable, and easy to drive.

This ES was a special edition and had a dark grey coloured trim in place of the usual wood. I like warm, natural colours in a luxury car (like the wood/taupe interior of the LS 430), and felt that the dark leather interior with dark trim made the interior feel drab and uninviting. She had no strong opinion on the interior, one way or the other.

We both agreed that the seats, like other Toyotas we have driven, were too short (no thigh support) and hard. They were reminiscent of the uncomfortable seats we disliked in the Highlander we test drove last January.

Since she was driving, I had a chance to look around the cabin more. I said it was like a Camry because the headliner material, moonroof surround trim and sliding cover, and plastic trim pieces (map lights, visor mirrors, dashboard, etc) were made of typical Camry/Accord quality, no better.

I admit I would have liked it more if it had a natural wood trim, but overall, it just didn't look or feel like a $35,000 car.

People we are talking middle class everymans, percieved luxury. There is not a whole lot of differnce in the materials of all these cars including the Subaru now.

In order to be considered an entry level luxo, not a perceived entry level luxo, the i's have to be dotted and the t's have to be crossed. It's inside and well as outside.

Needless to say you probably don't need more than 200-250hp to have great fun in a sports sedan. But as the sports luxury cars get a bit heavier with all the luxury and safety for example the Audi S4 need the benefit of the additional HP.

2701,rickrover,"August 18, 2004 5:37PM","I've owned several BMW's, mostly 3 Series, most recently an 01 X5 which just went off lease. In the past when my BMW lease was up I'd either turn it in and pick out a new one or purchase the old one - not this time. I liked the X5, never had a problem with it but grew tired of driving an SUV type vehicle and decided a ""sport wagon"" would fit my requirements. The 3 series is too small and due to be replaced next year, don't care for the 5 at all.

I'd decided on an Audi A4 Avant Ultrasport - had one on order.

Then I happened upon the Legacy GT wagon, my first test drive was an eye opener. It reminded me of a BMW, steering, handling, power delivery, amenities, material quality, etc.. On the way home from the test drive I started doubting my perception of it - It couldn't have been that good.

When I got home the latest issue of Bimmer magazine was in my mailbox, imagine my suprise when the Bimmer editor had test driven the new Legacy GT at Laguna Seca with a bunch of other cars - here are the comments:

""Driving on public roads tends to reveal less about a car's performance than driving on a fast track like Laguna Seca, but the first day's driving in the hills east of Monterey yielded at least one revelaton:
The Subaru Legacy GT has become a genuine rival to the 3 Series. Not only has Subaru made incredible strides where interior quality is concerned, but the car is fast (250 hp from its turbocharged 2.5-liter flat four) and involving. It's a thoroughly engaging driver's car with precise, neutral handling and perfect steering.""

So I wasn't going nuts after all -

Took the GT wagon (manual) for another test drive, confirmed my earlier impressions, signed on the dotted line and cancelled the Audi.

A month later I'm still very satisfied with my choice - waiting till 3k for the first oil change."

So some of the best fits that immediately come to mind are sedans like the 325i, G35, and IS300. Then others, like the X-type or C-class, come to mind. Does that mean there will be some gray area, like with the Acura TSX and TL? Sure, but that is part of the fun of trying to compare cars."

Yes, I have driven both and yes the M3 is super nice, and way better looking IMHO. But if you really had to make a run for your life in a car I would put my butt in a STi. ;-)

Will Subaru ever have a full size luxury car, I doubt it. They will have a larger model than the Legacy, and it will probably have alot of luxury. The crucial car for Subaru now is the new 7-Pass Halifax or Tribeca. That car has to come correct with alot of premium/luxury features and performance.

I'll admit even if Hyundai comes out with a car that meets all the above criteria I would still never buy one even if they are more reliable/luxurious.Everyone has they're biases towards certain brands correctly or incorrectly.

This is why the ""luxury"" brands have to tread carefully if they decide to move downmarket e.g. BMW 1 series,separating Ford from Volvo/Jaguar.
In Canada we have the Acura EL which is a gussied up Civic.So if we rebadge a car and all the cars in the lineup meet a minimum luxury level then we have a ""luxury brand"".

I love the M3, don't get me wrong. But when you say the M3-20K is NE to STi, you are intimating that it would still be better than the STi. That is an opinion I beleive to be false, and hard to justify.

The STi can up the level of interior materials, to the current Legacy standard, plus other extras like NAV and still be under the optioned out price of a 330i. It boggles my mind what Subaru could do with an extra 20K on a STi. Not to mention what an STi Legacy will be like.

My position is that if you add 20K to the STi despite it's detriment in dimensions, the M3 wouldn't be competitive as a small Luxury compact GT. And I mean it' wouldn't be competitive in luxury and God knows it' wouldn't in performance.

Now do I beleive the current STi is better. I beleive it is better fun for the purpose of all out driving. However, if I were single, would I rather hit the town in a STi or a M3 Convertible. Tops down on the M3 baby. ;-)

Kd… I haven't driven the STi but have driven the WRX, M3 and 330i. Let me tell you something, there are some people who are turned on by performance and don't need or want what is typically known as ""luxury"". It doesn't seem like this is your profile so I don't expect you to understand this.

When a performance driver gets going, the only things that matter are go, stop, turn… the thrill of the roller coaster. Stereos, fit n' finish, leather… all this stuff doesn't mean squat. To this kind of driver these Subies deliver some serious bang for the buck&#151;performance for a HELLUVA lot less. To get the performance of both WRX and STi in a BMW you HAVE to go to the 330 perf pack/M3 respectively and dish out the cash.

On the ""luxury"" aspect I've said this elsewhere. Some people classify luxury by way of butt-pampering characteristics. The thrill seeking driver sees naked performance as a luxury in itself. This is why people are willing to pay ransom's for Porsches that historically have had interiors on the level of military Jeeps. Does this disqualify Porsches as luxury cars? Not in my book. Do ""econobox"" characteristics detract from performance? It merely puts it into the dubious ""entry-level"" category. Keep denying this.

Now kd, I have to ask you, have YOU driven the cars in question? Doesn't matter though… I think I know what you expect from a ""luxury"" performance car, and I don't expect anyone who is thoroughly happy with a 330i to understand my points."

I could have easily got the EVO or STi as could all of us. But that is not in our target frame of reference, or else we'd all be on the Subie board, telling everyone our lastest conquer with our Sti.

There is no one better car. Car manufacturers design goals include a number compromises, your purchasing goals want to minimize the compromises or trade-offs and maximize the priorities. Aspects might include finances, looks, luxury, reliability, dealer service, gas mileage etc.
So you can't really say car a is better then car b in an absolute sense.

The Volvo S60R/V70R, however, is in a different class altogether. Faster, way more stable, feels lighter, much more agile, very fun to drive. In addition, the exterior and interior aesthetic design, as well as the quality of the interior materials (particularly the leather), are in another league."

I like these cars and the XC90 although I will probably never buy a Volvo due to the crappy treatment I got from a dealer in Santa Monica a few years back. I might eat my words when the XC90 with V8 comes out.

I do question the lighter feel and nimbler handling perception versus the Legacy. The Legacy is lighter by 300 lbs. They are way stable though and track turns well but nimble is not in Volvo DNA. The steering feel in a Legacy is more precise IMHO. Good brakes are standard for Volvo though. Comparing to the Benz or BMW in the price range for snow duty I would get the Volvo.

Comparing it to the Legacy GT, if you got the extra dough the Volvo is awesome."
2768,r34,"September 15, 2004 1:24PM","I think Volvo did something good to have S60R and the new S40 (esp T5).

For the other Swedan car maker, Saab, they need to work harder. Many people think that their technology is outdated and the 9-3 interior not not good.

Well, I looked at the 2006 A4 report in Edmunds yesterday. It mentioned that Audi added twin balance shafts that spin at twice the engine speed to A4 to minimize vibration.

""Balance shafts"" ? Sounds familiar. I checked both my 2001 9-3 & 9-5 owner's manuals and found that both cars were equipped with 2 balance shafts at that time. I am not sure when Saab put those in their cars.

I remembered I asked an Audi Salesperson whether the auto tranny of an A4 can learn the driver's driving style (adaptive transmission ??) and he told me no.

I think Saab has some nice and unique features that they didn't mention to people. Not that many people know Saab came up the idea of headlight wipers, heated seats, etc. The Marketing dept should be responsible for that.

Now 9-3 is more mainsteam. Maybe most people like it better than the old one. I missed the hatch. It needs something more than 210hp. Saab should create something like the Viggen with AWD for the 9-3 (I heard there will be a 9-3 sport hatch but AWD may not be an option)."
2769,dhanley,"September 16, 2004 5:06AM","Hmm--that was how i felt about the '900 i used to have. That car had lots of great features with a few glaring oversights/shortcomings. I also had the BMW then, which had fewer ""gee, neat"" features and less utility ( hatch, interior room ) but no real shortcomings i cared about. For example, the BMW engine didn't have that hammer-you-into the seat torque blast, with that cool motorcycle sound, but it didn't have the turbo lag either. The saab was sort of a headache and i chose to keep the BMW but i miss that car in general.

I recently seriously considered getting either a 9-3 or a 9-5. I really like them both but each had something that made me say ""wait"" although i was contemplating pulling the trigger in each case, once with a 9-5 aero ( used, 3000 miles ) and the other time with a new ARC. Both manual transmission. The 9-5's bane was handling/turbo lag and the 9-3's was the el cheapo GM interior. Both could be fixed, of course. I think simply sticking the ecotec in the 9-5 would improve it a lot; it's a lighter smaller engine ( for better weight distribution) with less turbo lag. The ecotec is also smoother. Another thing that irked me is the nature of the turbo with stick. You have to shift really fast or boost is largely lost between shifts. It's find if you're driving ""all out"" but not so great for maneuvers in traffic. Sort of the opposite of the GTO my cousin wants me to get. Even with my BMW i can start moving without using the gas, just easing in the clutch, while i felt quite choppy in both the saabs when starting off.

The lack of the hatch also miffed me.

Still, I'd rather have a car i really like with a few bugs than a car that is mostly ""reliable."" Kind of like dating the awesome girl with a few issues vs miss boring. And there's something about the saab that i at least want to like.

the new S40 is a great handler, better than any other volvos, seems like its time for them to start competing w/ the germans.

As for me, I think that S60R has the most comfortable seats of any vehicles I had a chance to drive. I'm not to crazy about the looks in and out, but this car has so much to offer that I will consider buying it anyway. It performs just as good and in many cases better than cars discussed on this board (handling on the same page as 330 with performance package) and at the same time if you switch suspension to comfort it's as soft as a lexus. Not only it handles grate it also give you grate acceleration 0-60 in 5.5 and almost no turbo lag."

2776,bmbmw,"September 18, 2004 3:35PM","Hi All;

I am getting close to making a decision on the above cars. I had the 325i for a test drive of 2 days and must say it is very nice. I found its over all ride and handling superb. I will test drive the 240 (Elegance, here in Winnipeg, Canada) next. I would like your thoughts and feed back on a few things...

What are you impressions of the upgrades to the '05 240? I think they are great and long over due, esp in the case of the CD player. To me they really enhance the quality/appearance of the interior.

What options have you purchased and would purchase again, and which would you not get again? I intend to keep my options (esp electronic) to a minimum as I find the models well equipped and the less electronics (IMO) the better.

I have found the stereo on my 14 year old toyota very good. I am not an audiophile, so would I notice or appreciate an upgraded sound system on either of these cars? I don't expect the standard system to be excellent, but is is at least ""Good""?

I have to say I find the exterior of the BMW very appealing over that of the MB, but the interior of the MB has the BMW beat. I love the comfortable sumptuousness of the MB interior.

My travel needs are modest. I will only put low city miles on it, will get the extended warranty, will ""baby"" it, and hope to keep it for 8 - 10 years.

While I think and feel both cars are excellent ( I find both engines more that adequate for my driving needs) I am inclined towards the 240. However my biggest reservation comes from concerns over MB quality. I understand it is not what it has been. I also understand that they are intentional about addressing this issue. I also read the the C class was early on plagued with ""bugs"". This was esp true in the 2001 and possible 2002 model years. Can I assume that most of these C class ""bugs"" have been addressed? What has been the experience of those who own 2002/03/04 vehicles? I dont expect a MB to be a good as a Japanese car, but I do expect it to be reasonably good and to hold its value over the long term.

I appreciate your thoughts...thanks.

B"
2777,m4d_cow,"September 19, 2004 8:13AM","if youre gonna take good care of it, both cars should last quite long with only minor problems.
reliability, like you said, will never beat japanese brands, but quite good overall, with MB being a bit more reliable in my case. 2005 MBs have new interior and seats, since a lot of people complained about the seats hurting their back on long trips.
Sound systems in both cars are quite good if youre not an audiophile, it has decent sound quality.
options id choose will always include xenon headlights (a must), wood trim (now std in bmws), and leather. i usually opt for premium package, but since you choose to skip the electronics, you might not need it afterall
hope it helps"
2778,eman6628,"September 20, 2004 4:45PM","If I were still living in Winnipeg and consider getting a RWD car, I would first consider the ground clearance, the more the better (I think the 240 has more clearance than the 325), then the next factor is winter tires options for the cars considered. All season tires are not very safe for winter driving in a city like Winnipeg and especially if you are going to baby it. I would consider looking at the 4matic and the xi too. Just my 2 cents."
2779,gordonwd,"September 24, 2004 2:36PM","I&#146;ve had my &#146;04 325i for about 5 months now, so I feel qualified to evaluate it and compare it to my previous car, a &#146;98 Audi A4 1.8T. These cars are similarly equipped, manual trans, non-sport package with all-seasons, about the same size and performance category, so a comparison seems fair at this point.

ENGINE &#150; Well, the 325 is rated at 35hp over the A4, so it&#146;s pretty much no contest. The engine is also smoother and really begs to be revved. The Audi would spool up pretty well, too, but I always felt like I was straining it a bit. I am also not sorry to lose the turbo, as I have always felt they add complexity under the hood that could be a long-term problem. In fact, the only major repair that I had to pay for on the A4 was a $500+ turbo-related issue.

TRANSMISSION &#150; Pretty even here with both being 5-speeds. The Audi had a bit softer of a clutch vs. the BMW&#146;s abruptness. I am only now at the point where I can consistently make a really smooth 1-2 shift.

HANDLING &#150; This is my first RWD car in many years, and I forgot how different it feels. The crisp turn-in is especially noticeable, and the steering overall has better feel than the A4. Ride-wise, the cars are pretty comparable: well controlled, firm but never harsh over rough pavement, typically German. The one thing the A4 had going for it was of course the Quattro AWD. One of my favorite things to do (you&#146;re never too old to be immature) was to out-drag someone at a stoplight on wet pavement. I could pretty well mash the pedal to the floor coming out and the car would just GO, leaving the other guy spinning his front (or rear) wheels. Even with traction control on a RWD or FWD, you&#146;re not going to beat AWD in slippery conditions.

INTERIOR &#150; Audi is known for interior design and the A4 did have very nice styling and controls layout. The BMW is not as well coordinated, but is a bit more business-like in its appearance. However, I like my particular color combination better than the A4&#146;s. The sand leatherette along with black floormats and dash, set off by the premium wood trim, makes for a nice look as opposed to the A4 that was all gray with some silver trim pieces. The leatherette in the BMW is also a bit nicer-appearing than the A4&#146;s.

The automatic climate control on the BMW is not quite as good at regulating temperature and air movement as the Audi&#146;s. The fan seems to blow too high in some conditions and not fast enough in others. The Audi definitely had the best auto-temp control that I have experienced.

EXTERIOR &#150; At the time that I picked out my A4, it was the E36 that I compared it against and I thought the A4 was better looking. But ever since the E46 came out the next year, my eye was always drawn to them when I spied one. I still think, though, that the A4 has classic good looks that I prefer to the newer model that was released in &#146;01. Likewise I expect that I will still prefer the E46 after the E90 comes out.

RADIO &#150; No contest here: the Audi had a much superior standard radio. On a few occasions, I&#146;ve wondered if the CDs that I&#146;m playing in the BMW are the same ones that I used to play in the A4.

INTANGIBLES &#150; I am not a status seeker, but from the reaction of many people that I know I can see that the BMW nameplate carries a lot more prestige than most others. Everyone knows what a BMW is, whereas I think that Audi is less known and tends to get lumped with other second-tier European cars. There is something about seeing that roundel on the steering wheel that makes me feel extra good about my choice.

SUMUP &#150; The 325i feels like a small performance sedan with luxury appointments and options; the A4 is more of a small luxury sedan that performs well. And there you have it (my opinion of course)."

The 2004 Saab 9-3, 2004 Acura TL, 2004 Lexus ES 330, and 2005 Mitsubishi Galant are rated good for side impact protection. The 2004 Saab 9-5, 2005 Mercedes C class, and 2005 Volvo S40 earned acceptable ratings. The 2004 Jaguar X-Type is rated marginal.

The better performers among vehicles that earn good ratings are designated ""best picks."" The Saab 9-3, which also earned a ""best pick"" designation in the Institute's frontal offset crash test, is the first car to earn this designation in both front and side crash tests. It's a ""double best pick.""

2784,jamesspot,"October 18, 2004 8:03PM","First off, hats off to Lexus for such a high class event and willingness to set up their 9 cars and 2 competitors in each category for the public to drive on a closed course. I went Saturday morning to FEDEX Field's (Redskin stadium) parking lot. There was a quick registration, orientation, Lexus autoshow display, cooking demo, kid's corner, a great buffet lunch, and golf pros to work with your swing, but the main event was driving on three different courses: luxury, performance, and SUV. I drove 10 of 27 different cars in 3 hours. All were automatics, traction control was required to remain engaged, and the rule was do not exceed the car's or your ability.

My notes on the cars of interest to this forum:

Lexus IS300: Underpowered six compared to the BMW and G35 with a transmission that had longer shift delays. Competent handling and decent brakes, but tended to understeer at the limit, leading me to plow one hard corner. Racy interior with easy to use controls. A ""good value"" choice if price and reliability are your top concerns in this segment. The car for my younger brother.

Infiniti G35: POWER! Oh, baby, this one has an engine. The interior was not as bad to drive as others would lead you to believe, but the handling is beneath the balance of the BMW and the Lexus. This is a car that makes the average driver (me) look bad. Saved by ABS and the traction control system from a potentially scary rear end spin. G35 owners have a reasonably priced, family-sized car with V8-like power, but you can only put it down on the track if you really know what you are doing. The car for a coworker who drag races on the weekends and takes four to lunch during the week.

Acura TL: If I were picking a car for my wife, sister, real estate agent, etc., this would be the one. Beautiful, jewel-like interior with state-of-the-art sound and ALL the features at a decent price. Plenty of power for the street. It just doesn't handle like a sport sedan with front wheel drive.

Mercedes C320: Softer ride, less-powerful engine, smooth transmission, nice interior. Others do different parts better at lower price points. Nice car, but nothing special for the money, pass. If you got the bucks and want the star, think AMG.

BMW 330i: OK, I'm biased, but this car makes the average driver look good with an ideal balance of engine, transmission, handling, and braking in a driver-oriented interior. Drove a premium packaged car with steptronic. Moving the shifter inboard to Sport and touching the DSC once (I didn't turn it off iaw the ""rules""), and the car performs: powerful acceleration (outmatched only by the G35), quick redline shifts that were the best, great brakes, and incredibly BALANCED handling. I was foot to the floor, threshold braking, hands spinnning the wheel, and having the time of my life. Much faster car for me because of the control available. The standard 330i is under tired (get the sport package for the performance tires, sport seats, and steering wheel). The steptronic (evaluated in ""S"" mode) was much better than I expected. Give me a little more power, more tire, and a manual - oh, that's my ZHP. I was still amazed at what a standard 330i can do, driven much harder than I've ever driven my car, which I have yet to track."
2785,riez,"October 18, 2004 9:17PM","jamesspot... What were the MSRPs for the respective vehicles? Too bad they were all automatics. (Amazes me that Lexus didn't use the 325ia. 325i outsells the 330i by about a factor of 3-to-1. 325i prices out, with similar options like an IS300. A decently optioned 330i can quickly push $40,000. Did the IS300 have optional LSD and VSC?)"
2786,jamesspot,"October 19, 2004 1:32AM","We just went from car to car. They had info posters highlighting the specs of each of the automobiles. Lexus was amazingly fair in their presentation of all the cars.
The class groupings had the IS300 with the G35 and the 330i, the ES330 (which I didn't drive) was grouped with the C320 and the TL.
The G35 and IS300 are low 30's cars, while a 330i step with premium package and the C320 are pushing 40k.
The IS300 did have traction control, I didn't know whether it had LSD or not.
I agree - the 325i is an even match for the IS300 price wise, the 330i is a much more expensive and capable car.
Since the event was for the general public invited by Lexus marketing, automatics were the only game in town for every car there. I think I was invited as I went to the Lexus web site and a dealership when I was looking at cars in the Spring. It did make me want to drive my car on the course!"
2787,dhanley,"October 19, 2004 4:01AM","I was recently at the ""autoshow in motion"" run by GM. It was pretty similar; in luxury cars there were all the saabs(9-2,9-3,9-5), the CTS, c320, TL, 325i, and the 530.

I thought the TL really plowed dissapointingly much in turns. Even my buddy, who's a huge honda fan, didn't like it. I think the TSX is significantly more fun. OTOH, the TL compares quite well with the c320.

The CTS is allright, i just think the interior needs to be upgraded, and it definitely needs the sport package. Same with the 9-3.

I may be biased, but even my honda-loving GM mechanic buddy liked the 2 bmw's the best. The 530 with the sport package was simply phenomenal.

But that's off-topic.

I also had a chance to drive the s40 t5 AWD. I really like the design, cabin, and volvo's environmental focus. I think it's a pretty good car, aside from fairly significant turbo lag. Oddly, it seems to me to have more lag with it's 2.5L than saab's almost-as-powerful 2.0L. It also still feels like a FWD car even with AWD. So, pretty nice, but not quite as sporty as i like. I like that you can get a ""high end"" car without leather and wood, neither of which i really care for.

I think i'll end up waiting to test the new 3-series before i order anything. And by then saab will have the 270hp turbo v6.

Well, driving different cars is fun!

The 3.6 L engine used in the CTS is pure GM designed and built. Its a great engine too, with plenty of HP and torque. Nice and smooth running too. GM is planning on using that same basic engine in lots of variations of size and power, as premium engines in their up market cars.

I owned an 04 CTS with that engine, and never had anything but good feelings about it. There were other aspects of my Cadillac buying experience that were far less satisfactory, but the engine and 5 speed auto transmision were world class."
2789,nkeen,"October 22, 2004 12:08AM","I own an '04 TL with 6 speed but have driven the TSX (auto only). My thought is that the TL is a Japanese implementation of an American concept whereas the TSX is a Japanese implementation of a European concept. The TSX is great fun to drive, but the TL has deep down power, is seriously fast, and is as relaxing on a long drive as a large Volvo, albeit not quite as comfortable. A couple of hundred miles passes with ease, which, despite their many supposed faults, is true of larger American vehicles. The TSX is more alive in your hands, less relaxed, ultimately not as fast.

The TL's clutch is fierce, but the shift is nice once you get used to it. Drive something else for a while and I guarantee you'll engage 1st with a bang when you next drive the TL. The TL's Bridgestone's aquaplane too easily -- makes me wish for my GTi's excellent Continentals."

That 8714 number includes more than B3 sedans (incl. also coups, convertibles...) although I am not sure what'd be the # for sedans only.

It's arguable whether TL/TSX or ES/IS should be combined comparing to 325/330. TL is not the same car as TSX, but 325 does not have the same engine as 330's either. Maybe you can compare TL with 330 and TSX with 325. But the 'smaller' 325 actually sells a lot more than the more powerful 330, opposite to TL vs. TSX or ES vs. IS. There's no easy way to really match up."

I can see reasonably informed rational buyers comparing FWDers like TL, TSX (the Euro-Accord), and ES to each other, but find it hard to see them comparing a RWD car, say a 330i or IS300, to a FWD car, like the ES330 or TSX. One drive in each will tell you how dramatically different are the two cars.

Marques that use one platform to compete across a broad market segment or many segments usually rely on lots of options, including engines, and available AWD. The 3 Series is somewhat unique in that it also includes station wagon, convertible, coupe, and M.

Lexus chooses to use two entirely different platforms. Infiniti used to until they dropped the I35, now relying on the G35 with its AWD and coupe versions to compete broadly. But it does cost more to develop and market two entirely different platforms, esp. when one (the ES) handily outsells the other (the IS)."

Of course, I do realize that most buyers worry more about things like stereo systems, cupholders, and wood trim than they do driving dynamics.

My focus on this board is on performance, not luxury. If you reverse the importance, you can readily come up with different results. And as the sales demonstrate, more buyers are interested in luxury over performance."

Drawing anything more from the above out of my words then you might be reading too sensitively. Relax.

As to whether people cross shop RWD cars to FWD cars, I think so. I am not saying everyone does that or it's right or wrong either way. From what I know many, admittedly perhaps mass average drivers, are flexible in terms of getting a FWD or RWD car, esp. in Cal. It's one of the factors, but often not the most important one, unless climate dictates. Even people who buy RWD cars, like many of my bimmer friends, admit they don't tell much difference on their day to day driving between their bimmers and, say their old Hondas. Well, maybe they'd not spend the $extra$ to get a bimmer as they can't fully appreciate the extra capability, but then, they might have gotten a bimmer for reasons other than just RWD."

2817,cdost1,"November 8, 2004 1:43AM","Folks,

Looking for a car. Here is the decision tree.

1. Should I go pre-owned certified with a late model Audi A6 ?
2. Should I go for a new entry level luxury sedan ?

I am trying to keep the price in the mid 30's. For the new entry level I have really not narrowed it down much. I have read some of the posts and heard great things about the new Acura TL, the Infiniti GX 35, the BMW 325ix, and the Saab 9-5.

I think based on the posts I have eliminated the Lexus 330 and the Subie.

I need to drive the car in the winter so I would probably go with a AWD if it is available.

I'll keep piling thru the posts but anyone who has anythoughts please let me know.

Thanks.

2818,pg48477,"November 8, 2004 1:56AM","I don't think there is a question about differences between RWD, FWD and AWD driving dynamics. However there is a fine balance of performance and luxury, specially in this car segment. I think mane people do cross shop all three three of them. One can say ""I got my IS for it's performance and not luxury', but I don't think it would be true statement, because IS is a Lexus and if you buying one you must care a grate deal about luxury.

As for me if TL was RWD I would already be driving one, it does not mean I would not buy one. I like G as well but driving dynamics of RWD and slightly better performance did not win over much better looking TL(in my mind), quality of the interior and slick MT. At the end of the day I do want to enjoy RWD even if i can only do it once a month, but on the other hand I think I will enjoy TL more as my every day car.

2821,evilangel,"November 8, 2004 8:16AM","These are just my 2 cents why i picked my C230K Sedan 2 days ago
1. Love the 2005 style, AMG style kit, standard 17"" RIMS and the big oval exhaust.
2. RWD
3. too many 325i on the road and the 2006 3-series will be out sometime next year, don't want to drive an ""old"" car in a couple months.
4. Dealer offered $4000 off MSRP that makes it around $30K w/ Auto, Sunroof, Xenon, and CD changer.
5. i can see the little star on the hood when i am driving... people are getting realistic nowadays
6. It's somewhat underpowered but i am ok w/ that coz i don't top my car more than 5% of the time 7. It's well balanced in terms of pricing, comfort, and performance.

About the 04 325i (my close friend got one and i have borrowed it over a weekend), engine is smooth, steering is responsive (hers doesn't have sport pkg)

Another friend got a 03 IS300, torque is great, gear is long (especially 1st and 2nd gear) fun to drive, but not worth the $33K, i paid my 05 C230K Sedan for under $30K

Audi 1.8T Quattro, some turbo lag, great style, price bumped up a lot with all that options. If you are considering the Audi, wait till next year's 2.0L direct injection engine that had 200horses and faster response

only spend about 3 miles in the TL. It's FAST!!! some torque steering, interior is great, comfortable, tons of standard features. but it depreciates more than a BMW and MBZ and it's still a Japanese car. If they make it RWD, it will replace my MBZ in my garage. I think if Acura make the TL RWD, it will cost at least $3000 more."

The TSX (Euro-Accord) is a nice car. Reasonably priced. Excellent value. Great size. But to be serious, you have to have the 6-speed manual, in order to wring the most out of the high-reving enging.

2. Of course, when discussing FWD performance, the Mini immediately comes to mind. Still, even the ""underpowered base model"" will outhandle any car in this forum's segment, and is a blast to drive.

Also, the Volvo V40 T5, Saab 9-3, Mazda 6, and TSX all offer performance that's comparable to any car in this forum's segment.

More useable torque, esp. at low(er) RPMs. The TSX would be a blast to drive hard on the track, though you'd be shifting a lot and running very high RPMs. I don't do too much of that. I tend to stay in 3rd and 4th gears when ""playing"" with my car on the twisties in the real world. What are the RPMs for a TSX 6-speed in 3rd gear at 60 mph? 4th at 80 mph? (I do miss my old '98 540i6. Great engine and transmission.) Despite all the attempts, no one yet has repealed the laws of physics for front-heavy powerful FWDers. Ugly things like torque steer. That is why Acura, Audi, and Subaru use AWD.

rroyce10... Geographics can have a huge impact on sales. Friend of mine lives in a metro area that has about 100,000 people (say within 50 miles radius), but that area does NOT have a single Audi, BMW, MB, Acura, Infiniti, or Lexus dealer.

In fact, i just got back from the Lexus event in Houston. I test drove about 15 cars on the test track. I thought the FWD drive acura TL handled vastly better on the course than the Mercedes 320 and the Lexus GS 300.

A 4 cylinder car is more than enough for a small/medium size sedan nowadays. 6 isnt a plus or minus, it lowers your gas mileage and raise the maintainance fee a bit. If you look at TSX gas mileage, its very impressive (22/31 VS 18/24). Unless the 6 produces 50% more of Hp/torque, but again you wont be needing them in the real world.

Oh yeah, the AManti and XG350 have excellent low prices and great feature content. But guess what. To get the great feature content at a great price, something has to give. Sure, Hyundai's quality has improved greatly, but it ain't up to Toyota standards. Hyundai may be making strides in the IQS study, but tell me when it gets there in Long term dependability and it consistently ranks at the top.

I have driven a '03 possibly ES300 loaner about a year ago and I have driven the XG350(not Sonata). Sorry but the XG350 is not comparable in anyway to the ES. Not in terms of feature, quality, ride, performance, fit & finish. Nothing, nadda. The leather in the XG350 is low quality, the plastics are cheap, the overall interior feel is cheap.

Data i got from other forum,

04 325i 36month 12k/yr, residual 61%
05 TL 36month 12/yr, residual 58%

when we lease car, the residual is calculated based on the MSRP, for BMW, it's already a good deal if u can get $500 over invoice, for TL, it's hard to even knock off $500 from the MSRP, however, i am getting close to $4000 off MSRP for the MBZ. In conclusion, the larger the gap between the MSRP and the selling price, the less depreciation you will have to pay
(assume that the residual are the same).

I've done some research when i lease my C230K, i can get $399 plus tax ($0 down) on a C230K w/ MSRP of $34000, while i have to pay around $20 more ($0 down) per month for a TL w/ MSRP of around $32900. Not to mention that the MBCC charge more on the interest.

It's a given that the reliability of German car is always a ?, that's why i lease the MBZ so that i don't need to worry about reliability issue and i did have 4 toyotas before (still having a 03 4runner and i have to admit that Japanese cars are problem free)

I am sorry but i shouldn't have made the ""still a Japanese car"" comment, yes, you can feel it when u r sitting inside a MBZ or BMW or even a VW, (did own a 1999 VW golf before) may be it's my personal bias.

I have over 20 years of FWD driving under my belt in addition to my 15 years of RWD driving (most of it in snow country), and of our current three cars (2-FWD & 1-RWD), I'll choose the BMW over the other two when it comes to any trip in the snow, short or long. In my case, I live 40 miles or so north of Boston, however, I have clients down in the NYC area and make the trip at least once a month (some months are more like 4 trips), and unless I have some specific reason (like taking the kids who like to watch movies while on long trips), it'll be the 530i every time.

FWIW, I used to be a FWD/AWD bigot; that is until I put winter tires on my car in 2002. Prior to that, I was convinced that RWD simply required too much work to drive safely in the slippery stuff. When I did finally break down and get the winter tires, I was simply astounded at the difference. That car is now (by far) the easiest car to drive in the snow that I have ever driven.

Sure it does. By sheer distance I am calculating risk based on law of averages, % risk, and variable road conditions.

For example, I could make it one mile up the road in my Audi with Z-rated summer tires. however, I would NEVER drive any further since odds dictate that my minimal traction would eventually cause me to lose control and crash.

Anyways, I'm way off topic now. Just glad to hear RWD is usable in snow since I'm currently an AWD/FWD bigot.

Now that you mention that, I might be heading to the Infiniti dealer to get a nice G35 coupe 6-speed. That car is amazing. Just have to convice the wife that the G35c is better than the TL. That'll be harder than driving uphill with RWD and summer tires."

2881,riez,"November 13, 2004 3:39PM","No matter what you drive (AWD, 4WD, FWD, RWD), your car will benefit from using dedicated snow tires. One reason the more driving-serious Europeans drive about 75% summer/winter tires vs only 25% all-season tires. Percentages reversed in USA.

Is fascinating that so many Americans will spend $30-50K on a sport sedan but then drive on mediocre all-season tires. All that separates you and the road is a small contact patch of rubber. Buy the best tires. That means dedicated summer (really 3-season) tires and dedicated winter tires.

Key to safe winter driving is driving skill. Traction is reduced. Modify your driving habits. Select the right gear. Apply the throttle differently. Take things slower.

Nothing used to bring a bigger smile to my face more in winter than driving my RWD '97 Camaro with snow tires and seeing all the SUVs in the ditch during a snow storm because their foolish driver thought they were invulnerable to winter conditions.

Simple, in reverse. ;-) I was on my way to an assignation which included an almost empty rental ski condo, a hot fire and good food and wine, up in Boyne City, MI and all that stood between me and Valhalla was a VERY steep, slippery, snow and ice covered dirt road. After several attempts to climb the hill nose first, I sat at the bottom for a few minutes and thought about the situation logically. I popped it in reverse, and climbed that hill with absolutely no problem.

When I pulled up in front of the condo she came out and asked, ""How in the hell did you get your car up here? I needed to park in town and bum a ride from somebody with a Jeep.""

2890,designman,"November 13, 2004 9:47PM","Alright, I have to throw in two cents to keep this place honest.

I used to live in 10,000 feet up in the Colorado Rockies. At first I was intimidated by the thought of snow storms and compromises with mobility. Then I quickly realized that the snow crews are nothing like NYC areas where you sometimes have to wait a day to have roads cleared. In dem dere mountains snow barely had a chance to touch the ground before they would clear the roads (the more populated areas anyway). My brother lived in Montreal and it&#146;s pretty much the same way. So it seems to me that one&#146;s daily conditions play a role when considering winter driving equipment. If you can whisk your way onto clear roads and highway, the risk of getting marooned is considerably lower.

I often find myself on lots of hills with plenty of deep stuff and/or ice. I know a thing or two about getting by with two wheels, but nothing beats AWD in snow&#151;nothing. Never even came close to having a snag. You have to use more skill and savvy with the others, like taking circuitous routes home, maintaining momentum into a hill or driving uphill backwards. Not many people would think of these things.

I agree that all-season tires are not the way to go with RWD and FWD. They have mostly summer-tire characteristics and I would only use them with AWD. Even then, they compromise traction, braking and handling in snow.

Bottom line here. Driving in snow with RWD and FWD is like jogging with Florsheim wingtips. Sure, you can do it. But a G35x, 325xi or anything else like this is a great choice.

Shipo, your Mom should be proud of you&#151;I see nothing wrong with that sentence. I would imagine however that she wouldn&#146;t approve of your 100 mph jaunts ;-)

2893,shipo,"November 14, 2004 12:23AM","Hmmm, I gotta disagree with you about some if this. I regularly drive two FWD cars and one RWD car shod with winter tires, and I think that there is little comparison, the RWD car seems to have significantly better traction in all driving regimens. So, based upon that, I would suggest a slight change to your chart for traction (I assume we are only talking about acceleration here):

1) AWD w/Winter Tires
2) AWD w/All-Season Tires*
3) RWD w/Winter Tires*
4) FWD w/Winter Tires
5) FWD w/All-Season Tires
6) RWD w/All-Season Tires

* I'm not completely convinced that the AWD car with All-Seasons would be of any advantage over the RWD car with winter tires.

Then again there are the issues of handling and braking, and if I remember the results of the side-by-side test performed by an auto magazine several years ago using cars as nearly matched as possible (MB E320 4-Matic, MB E320 RWD, Audi A6 Quattro, Audi A6 FWD) the results shifted more in favor of the Winter tire shod RWD car. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, in the braking department, the RWD car easily won due to its inherently more neutral front/rear weight distribution (especially compared to the FWD A6) combined with its (relatively) lighter weight (compared to the two AWD cars).

Personally, I am willing to give up some ""go power"" to gain some ""stop power"", hence my comment that I believe that a RWD car (especially one with a near neutral weight distribution) shod with winter tires offers the best driving experience for winter driving. That said, if I lived in a mountainous area such as the Rockies, I would certainly opt for the AWD car simply because on a steep enough hill, the FWD/RWD car simply ain't gonna start moving from a standing stop while the AWD car will move away from the stop with relative aplomb. ;-)

I will admit that driving a RWD coupe/sedan is just a completely different experience from a FWD. In this case, different is much better. The handling, acceleration, and braking are all a world better.

I am aware of the G35x, but I was really hoping to get the 6-speed. Of course, the wife wandered over to the FX35 and I knew it was all over. Fortunately, this is MY car so there's a chance that I will win this battle.

The dealer had some '05 G35x's in stock, but I didn't get a chance to see one or drive one. The interior is supposed to be up in quality now vs. the 04's. Unfortunately, the 6-speed won't be around until late January or February...and I need a car NOW since mine is totalled.

Thanks for all the comments on winter tires and such. I'm paying cash for the car anyways, so I might as well just take $1000 and get a quality set of winter tires. Then I can run summer/winters and have it all. Geeze, having your cake AND eat it too...say it ain't so!

2896,williamhill,"November 14, 2004 6:26PM","I have two sets of winter tires also for both cars. I dont mind the trouble of switching them and spending $1k for a set of spare wheels n winter tires. Well it keeps you out of trouble, eventhough they still spin a little bit but not as often. I have to stay with my (the only/last) insurance company (some accidents before)

And I also put some heavy stuff in the trunk, so if the FWDer has an engine on top of their front wheels, I got my small loaded fridge on the top of my rear wheels. well it works.! It does help traction and a happy 20-35 mph on snow. lol"
2897,pg48477,"November 15, 2004 12:53AM","I just came back from the dealer they had 2005g35x. Did not get a chance to drive it but spend some time in the car. I do find that seat controls are in the wrong spot, but the seat is very comfortable both driver and passenger. Even though interior design is pretty much the same as 04, materials used are much better. Gages are still orange but way better looking than 04 and does not look at all like the one in Altima. Before interior was the only thing in the way of buying a car and I was leaning more towards TL, but now I think G is the one. Have to convince my wife to get a 6MT and the deal is done."
2898,kyfdx,"November 15, 2004 1:46AM","Well.. I was trying to show there is a big difference between ""go power"" and ""stop/turn"" power..

I've had four AWDs with three different AWD/4WD systems, and everyone of them had better traction (go power) with all-seasons than any 2WD car I've driven with winter tires, including my current one..

And although I would rather have RWD/winters than FWD/winters for the overall handling experience (stop/turn/go power), if I am considering only traction (go power), I still have to go with the FWD.

I will grant that the type of car makes a difference though.. A large car with a long wheelbase loses some of the traction advantage that FWD provides, by moving more of the weight off the front wheels.. My old '82 Accord hatchback with 63-64% of the weight over the front wheels would leave any RWD car spinning its wheels... A new TL or ES300 would have much less advantage over a 5-series or GS300.

Since my car is totalled, I am in need of a car very very soon. Puts me in quite the pickle. I don't really want to settle for an 04, but I can't think of any other choice...besides renting a car until that time (ouch $$$!).]

I do agree the placement for the seat adjustment is wrong, but the seats are quite comfortable (if you are not tooo wide in the backside).

I suppose I could settle with the automatic '05, or even an 04 6-speed, but something tells me I'll regret it. On the other hand, aren't the 04's going for well under invoice now??? There's quite a few things I can spend $3-$4k on...

I drove all 3 cars was leaning toward the BMW but it seems a bit underpowered vs the other 2 in the decision set. Am I making a mountain out of a mole hill or is should this be a concern.

Also I heard from some folks that the TL tends to develop some rattles reasonable quickly after purchase.

Thanks for any counsel."
2912,m4d_cow,"November 24, 2004 1:19PM","rattles: as far as i heard its true w/ the previous TL, but i never heard of such complaint with the new TL

the 325xi might seem a bit underpowered, but its all about your preferences. with G35x you'll get the power but sacrifice the comfort and luxury due to its harsh ride and low quality materials. th TL has both power and comfort for $33k, quite a decent offer. if power is on top of your list, the g is worthy, but if you want luxury along w/ it you might wanna consider the bmw or the TL. hope this helps"

2914,sevenfeet0,"November 24, 2004 1:31PM","Velostic, with all due respect, you're missing the point of the CTS. This car was never designed to look, drive or handle like the larger models, especially the Deville or the old outgoing Seville. I for one am very happy that this car is nowhere near the handling, road feel or performance or my old Deville.

Also, the CTS already has a V8 model..the hot rod CTS-V. THere is no indication that there will be any other kind of V8 version of this car in non-hot rod form."

I am curious about your comment on the low quality materials on the G35x. Would you be able to elaborate a bit ?

This car for me is about being fun to drive. Our other car is a 2004 Acura MDX which acts as family wagon. I need the practicality of a sedan but beyond that I want something that will perform well and be a fun ride and age well. My boss has a 325 and says it drives with 100k miles like it was new.

I have had great luck with 3 Nissan's so just when I was about to eliminate the G35x I decided to keep it in the mix.

Not sure how much snow you get where you are but the front wheel drive of the TL handles the white stuff quite well. The car is definitely fun to drive and the AT version does not have any real torque steer to be concerned with. I reaaly liked the performance characteristics of the G35 but could not warm up to the interior. The 330 was a little out of my price range and the general small interior size of the 3 series also did not work for me. All 3 are great vehicles however, enjoy the decision making process."

Thanks much. Just when I think I am leaning in one direction I get a note like yours and I am back to undecided. I think the 330 is going to be out of my range also but I figured I would at least check it out.

As far as the snow goes I am in Northern NJ so some winters are real bad some not so much. Need the FWD or AWD for piece of mind though. I have RWD SUV now and I buying this car because the SUV is a tobaggan in the snow.

One question. I have read in another forum about a problem with vibration on the TL at highway speeds 55 - 60 mph. Have you had any experience with this ?

well, compared to the other 2 the g35 just feels a lot cheaper inside. the plastic feels and looks cheap, and imo the leather seats are overly firm, and many people said the seats hurts their backs on long rides.
on the positive side i wont deny that the g is fun to drive, while i'd say the TL is the least fun to drive since it doesnt handle as nicely as the other 2."

Technical Editor Mike Miller has some fascinating comments in the February 2005 issue of Bimmer magazine. As Mike points out in his article on manual transmission and differential fluid changes:

Pre-""free"" ""recommended"" maintenance intervals:
- 1,200 mile break-in service
- oil changes every 3,000 miles
- automatic transmission fluid and filter change every 15,000 miles
- manual transmission fluid change every 30,000 miles
- differential fluid changed every 30,000 miles
- brake fluid chance annually
- coolant fluid changed every 2 years

Post-""free"" ""recommended"" maintenance intervals:
- No initial break in service (except M)
- Oil and filter change around 15,000 miles
- No automatic transmission fluid or filter changes
- No manual transmisison fluid changes
- No differential fluid changes
- brake fluid changed every 2 years
- coolant fluid changed every 3 years

He also points out:

""BMW dealership technicians no long open up gearboxes and differentials for repairs. Instead, the factory fix is to buy a BMW remanufactured gearbox or differential--or automatic transmission-instead.""

""No one knows exactly what BMW's proprietary ATF is, so no one knows if there are viable alternatives.

  This is my first new car, and I agonized/obsessed for months over decision of which to buy. As we have an eleven year old and drive to Ohio two or three times a year, a sedan with a somewhat roomy interior was mandated. I was loving the Saab 9-5 Aero, but only with large incentives would I go for a car that stickered for 43K. I liked the Saab MPG, but turbo lag bites. Saab also had no rear or curtain airbags. Volvo S-80 was also expensive, had the airbags, but the interior and trunk seemed smallish and was down on power. M-B, Audi & BMW 3 were too expensive. A friend has the 330 Xi, and wonders if her thirteen year old will fit much longer...
I hated the BMW 5, anyway.
  So, here I am. AWD is fine with me; I may be able to finally forego winter tires. I'm across the river in Westchester, btw. Coming from a '94 Accord LX, the Inf. seems plenty lux for me!. The mpg should even be better for you coming from an suv. I probably paid a little more than I should have, but the ""buying experience"" was ok. Ramsey Inf. had some good quotes; try the website. Good luck, and let us know what happens."

2939,joeshan,"December 7, 2004 9:11PM","Howdy, AEG. I bought from Pepe. They have some leftovers, but they are not going to lose money, as there will always be another customer along in the future, and they have something that we want. I was afraid that dealer servicing would be difficult if I bought from say, Ramsey, and had to go to Pepe for service, as Jersey would be really inconvenient.
  The salesman did his job as a salesman despite my best efforts to do mine as a consumer, but he was a gentleman, as was the business manager. They both did me a couple of favors that saved me a few bucks. I feel that I was not taken advantage of. Short of a direct plug, the big Irish fella whose desk is right next to the Pumpkin colored FX sold me the car. Remember though, they're not really about the price dickering. At least they still know my name four days later!
  I haven't really flogged the car as I am breaking it in, but that gas gauge isn't afraid to move...
  I happened to catch a Discovery Channel program about auto safety recently that showed an offset front crash test of a G35 (ugly green) from 03, and the engineers demonstrated that the results were satisfactory. I don't know why NHTSA hasn't posted the results, or maybe it was the insurance company people testing the car.
  SAAB's policy of glacial changes turned me off-Why can't they do curtain airbags in the 9-5? The 9-3 has them, but it's smaller.
  The S-60 is too small. The S-80 had everything I wanted, but it, had less power, and felt tighter inside. Big Dee had one AWD in Nov. and seemed willing to deal, but the Volvo was primarily FWD, which I'm kinda sick of.
  Plus, there are the perceived factors (correct or not) of Swedish unreliability and weirdness associated with the Saab.
  I'd love to visit Scandinavia, but I wonder if the dollar's weakness make the EDP economical?
  Every owner and professional review of the G35 & G35X that I read was overwhelmingly positive; the most prevalent negative from the owners was the gas mileage. The fact that I've got a car that is comparable to a 3-Series with more room, Japanese reliability, and lesser insurance costs for about 10 large less tickles me.
  I think Road&Track did a multicar comparo of near-luxury sedans a couple of years ago, and the G35 won! That article really made me investigate the G35, and here I am now.

Hey thanks for all the information. Still agonizing so I think I am going to have my wife drive the cars as well and come up with a consensus although I will have veto power !! (My car - she just got her car a 2004 Acura MDX)

 

My understanding there is a seperate forum to discuss price and buying experience. If you would not mind it would be great to know what you paid. Also I got the impression you bought a 2004. Is that the case ? I have some price information from Edmunds on the 2005 but not the 2004. I suspect I will probably buy the car in NJ at one of the 2 local dealers down by me (Summit and Denville) unless somebody knocked me out with a deal. Based on your comments that seems unlikely.

 

Thanks for all of your comments. I may go out today and narrow it down some more. (Probably down to the BMW and GX with a slight chance on the TL.) I think I am now leaning to the GX though. I'll post details when I finally decide.

I'm near you. I tried the GX AWD. I was not impressed with the way it handled on the highway (lots of road noise), and the brakes were really, really touchy (common complaint). The Summit infinit dealer is very nice.

 

Denville dealer is nice, just won't go down on their prices.

 

Have you considered the FX by infiniti? That's really nice, and you might be able to scoop up a really good deal on a 2004.

 

Snagged a 325xi wagon elsewhere (c. 12,000 miles certified), but haven't been impressed with the gas mileage, yet. If I had known, might have picked the FX (if presented with a really good deal), but this summer was cringing at gas prices.

2968,darrenw,"December 27, 2004 8:40PM","hi cdost, cargal and everyone,

 

I'm currently looking for a new car. I have the 300C, 3's, G35, ES and TL in my list.

300C is off the list because I wasnt impressed by it's handling, front grill and interior, but boy the car was really flying. I guess its time to move up to a real entry luxury performance class

 

Test drove the ES, everything is perfect except for acceleration, speed and handling. And I guess this one is also off my list.

 

Now I'm leaning towards the last 3 cars. I would have taken the TL off my list after reading some comments, but I decided not to (not yet).

I havent test driven the car, no so crazy about it. Too many of them on the street.

 

Having said that, I did some research on the new TL on all car related websites, NHTSA and many others. I'm quite surprised that ES'04 has more trans failures than all those 3's, followed by 3's, G35

and TL'04. (I couldnt find any about trans failure on TL'04, is this for real?

but more on BMW3'04, G35'04 and especially the ES'04)

 

I'm going to test drive the G35 this afternoon and 330/325 later on. I'm hoping that G35 is the one. I love that sexy looking car.

 

One question though, I read some post that the G35X is not as fast as the G35 and I also heard the 6MT has problems with it's transmission. According to some, Infiniti just hasnt issued a recall unless more people complain.

Is there any other things that I should look at (I understand that the interior is probably the cheapest among the other 3 but I can live with that)?

 

Thanks, darren"
2969,m4d_cow,"December 28, 2004 2:15PM","Trans failure was common on TL's pre 04 models, but i rarely heard of such problem happening to newer models.

while imo the TL is the fastest, it doesnt handle as nicely as the other 2, particularly the torque steer and (sometimes) floaty ride at high speeds.

 

The gx is slower, true, and somehow its handling isnt as impressive as the rwd model as well. i never drove the 6mt so i cant say anything about it. also, if ride-comfort is on your list you really should try before buying, since many people (including me) think the rides harsh and uncomfy on longer rides. one more thing, try the seats for a while to make sure youre comfortable w/ it, the seats controls are awkwardly placed and might hurt you on longer rides.

 

3ers are ok, quite underpowered and overpriced though. i say comfort is better than the g but still second to the TL. oh and prepare yourself for minor electrical problems (common w/ any bmw models)

 

hope it helps, goodluck"
2970,riez,"December 28, 2004 7:32PM","darrenw... If you are looking at BMW 325i or 330i AND you looked at the Lexus ES330, you should consider the Lexus IS300. Both 325i and IS300 are RWD and similar in size.

 

The IS300 has consistently scored well with Consumer Reports, JD Powers, and Intellichoice. And its crash test results for NHTSA and IIHS have been very good. Lexus has better standard warranty though BMW has ""free"" maintenance. Believe Lexus' extended warranty is much less expensive than BMW's."
2971,cdost1,"December 29, 2004 4:13AM","Folks,

 

Saw all the posts. I will try to answer them as succintly as possible.

 

I eliminated the the TL pretty quickly. Liked the drive not that crazy about the look. (I just bought an MDX two months ago.)

 

First on my quotes. The best I could do on the 325xi in NJ was 36,299. On the 330xi 40,299. These quotes included Premium Pkg, Leather, upgraded stereo auto transmission, wood trim. The quotes came from 2 different dealers JMK (325xi) Flemington (330xi). I don't think the mats are typically included in the BMW pricing but I did not really haggle here since I ended up purchasing a G35x.

 

After driving all 3 cars I decided on the Infiniti. I think I liked the tighter handling of the BMW but the 325xi just seemed way underpowered compared to a G35x. This just was my feel. I am sure a BMW loyalist would argue I don't know what I am talking about but that is what it felt like to me. The 330xi would have been great. More power than the 325xi and tighter than the G35x but I could not rationalize the additional $6500 in price for a car with less backseat and room with a 3 year old.

 

I saw the posts on the RWD and really cannot comment since I wanted an AWD and only drove them. Again speed and power seemed relative and a RWD was not in the decision set.

 

The G35x felt nice to me. (My last 2 cars were Maximas) It handled nicely and had plenty of pep. Believe it or not it seemed to run quieter than the 325xi as well.

 

The last thing is I have had 3 Nissan's and none of them owed me anything when I gave them up (All with 8 - 10 years and 150k+ miles). That was the final factor.

 

I am picking it up tomorrow and assuming I do not jerked around at the last minute my 2005 G35x will cost $34,250 with Premium C Pkg, Full Size Spare and Wood Trim. The only thing not in here is TT&L. Splash guards are not available at the moment on the 2005 G35x.

 

I hopes this helps everyone.

 

If I have any surprises I will chime back in.

 

Regards,

Craig"
2972,darrenw,"December 29, 2004 7:58PM","Thanks for the replies guys,

 

I test drove the G35 yesterday,

After I started the car, I 've noticed some rattle noises (chattering gear noise) when launching from a stop.

It seemed coming from the drivetrain.

I asked the salesman, he said it's normal because the engine was cold.

I couldnt help looking at the rim, there was a lot of brake dust. How long do they last(brakes)?

Is there any way to improve the ride on the car? road and engine noise, vibration and stiff suspension.

 

But everything else was perfect, except for interior and audio which I dont really care so much.

I loved its handling and imo its one of the best looking cars.

I told my wife, that I didnt want to go to any other place but she insisted to go to a BMW dealership.

Apparently she didnt like the ride. Well...tough luck charlie, I just didnt want to upset her.

 

Went to a Bimmer dealership, and test drove a 325i.

The car was too small for us and wasnt powerful enough compared to the G35 although it rode slightly better than the G, tighter handling and better interior/audio. I guess 325 is out of the picture.

Anyway I decided to test drive the 330i. It felt more powerful than the 325 but not the G35.

Has anyone noticed the wind noise, tougher ride/vibration (slightly better than the G), and somehow weak? power steering? or was it just that car?

The car was smaller and a lot more expensive.

 

I understand that sporty ride means stiffer suspension, I just wish my wife does too

 

I wanted to go back to the Infiniti dealership again. A funny thing happened, the salesman was upset when I asked about his opinion on Acura TL. Have to admit, it made me curious.

 

Riez, thanks for the suggestion but I think the IS is too small for us. but I'm sure its a good car.

 

Tommorow I need to go to another G35 and Acura dealership. Hope I can get it before the year end,

some said its the best time to buy a car!

 

Thanks for the info cdost1, greatly appreciated, I might go with the rwd.

Is it true that the cars MPG is not that good? how bad can it be?

Anyway have a good time and enjoy your new car, buddy!

 

m4d_cow, Eventhough I'm almost convinced that I'll go with the G35 but it doesnt hurt to test drive the TL. Have to buy it by friday.

(Unless the TL has less vibration/ wind noise/ engine noise, handle as good as the G/3's, faster than 330, better MPG and softer ride)



Thanks for your help."
2973,fedlawman,"December 30, 2004 4:43AM","My opinion of the TL is that, using your references, it handles significantly better than the ES330, but it's not as sharp as the G35.

 

On the other hand, the TL rides significantly better than the G35, but it's not as creamy as the ES330.

 

It may turn out to be the perfect sport/comfort mix you're looking for - plus, it's interior materials and layout are a couple notches above the G35."
2974,fedlawman,"December 30, 2004 4:57AM","Just in case anyone was wondering, here's an update on my TSX relationship...

 

Yes I still enjoy the car very much. However, in spite of the fact that it's made Car and Driver's ""Ten Best List"" for two straight years now, my initial impressions are proving to be true.

 

After 18 months of ownership, the thrill is starting to fade. Yes, I know - it has a gorgeous cockpit, peppy acceleration, and nimble handling, but like all Honda's...it's lack of ""soul"" is beginning to take it's toll on me.

 

I might start modding it (summer tires, rear sway bar, coil-overs, I-H-E) to make it sportier and add some personality, or I may finally get serious about leaving this segment behind (do I really want to be here?) and replace it with something more sporting and less luxurious.

CTS-V's are rated at 16/25, only a couple of mpg less than a G35. Plus, you don't have to get on it to go really fast. The Vette engine has always been noted for getting excellent gas mileage for such a powerful engine.

 

I've seen plenty of reports on TH of G35's getting bad gas mileage, but I haven't seen that argument as much of a reason not to buy it.

 

Plus, the performance difference between a G35 and a CTS-V is significant, to put it mildly.

 

""A friend of mine bought a $50K used Porsche on-line, after his experience, I would never do something like that.""

 

This is a dealer, not some guy selling online. I bought my Miata by finding it online, then going to the dealer, who was a couple of hundred miles away. Full factory warranty (4 years/50K miles)would be in effect as well.

 

I certainly wouldn't be fearful of a car with 851 miles on it."

When I bought my Miata, it was almost 3 years old, but only had 11K miles on it. Ran a Carfax and it turned out it had had 3 owners, none of them private.

No problem, bought the car and other than it having a broken roof latch header when I got it (fixed under warranty, which still had a few months to go), it's been perfect.

well, the TL has all on your list except for the handling, still quite a few notch below g/3ers. TLs ride and comfort are practically the best among the 3 choices

 

id have chosen the tl when i bought my car if only it doesnt have that annoying torque steer, and im not crazy about the looks for sure.

the 330s ride is harsher cos its equipped w/ sport suspension (standard on all 330is), though sadly the gs ride is still harsher compared to bmws w/ sport suspension.

 

so if you can sacrifice a little handling the TL is totally worth it.

Very high end of the scale there. Most CTS aren't anywhere near that much. And there are obviously a large number of people like their sports sedans not to beat them up.

 

It's also a bigger car... many people also appreciate the space it offers.

 

The 3.6 is underpowered only in some alternate universe. 255 hp and 252 lb/ft of torque on regular gas.

 

""Then you have to look at it. 300C beats Caddy at their own game for $5-$7K less.""

 

Have you driven one? I have. The 300C is not nearly as good as an all around vehicle. Fast in a straight line, sure. But throw in some corners and there's lots of body roll and tire squeal. Caddys don't do any of that.

 

300C lacks the chassis composure to be a sports sedan.... it's a fast cruiser.

And the GS competes against a different class of cars: E-class, A6, and 5 Series.

I'm quite happy with the G, especially when the car will only be driven by me. My family just cant handle the ride.

 

Imo the TL is more like a handsome, muscular looking car while the G is more to the sweet and exotic type. Eventhough the TL rode & turned as flat as the G, but I do believe there's a hair difference somewhere.

Curious on what you decided. I have had my G35x for about 10 days now and so far know regrets. Even had it out in some wet snow tonight and it was fine.

 

I found that all of the cars in the mix you were looking at did not have such great MPG. If you are talking about these high powered engines I suspect this has something to do with it. It looks to me that I will be getting somewhere around 325 to 350 miles on a tank with all the city driving I do. Not much different than Explorer my Infiniti replaced.

 

The only reason I nixed the TL was just looks. It drove nice and actually had a few more features for less money since it was FWD vs AWD.

 

Hope you found the car you wanted.

Sorry, but because of it's inherently flawed FWD design, no TL is superior to a CTS, no matter how many gadgets you pile onto it.

FWD has always served me well, so even with the improved traction/safety of AWD, the added weight and complexity were not appealing to me).

This contest is like the beauty contest that I saw in Thailand when I was on vacation in 2000. Everyone thinks there's gonna be a lot of pretty girls (common conception about supercar/super beauty) but ""super"" actually meant a contest with a heavy (really heavy) modification. I asked one of the girl (named ""ferrari"") in the audience , ""you are very attractive, why dont you go and compete"". She said no very quickly! Real girl wont compete with these ""queens""

(Why? Because we cant keep up with the demand)

 

Will you marry the prettiest girl of that contest? (why the sales was not good?)

 

Guess who turned out to be a winner, a drag queen but HE was really pretty and acutally much prettier than that girl. HE just doesnt sell much in his ordinary life.

""Car and Driver enough to provide a link, why not explain why they picked the FWD Acura TSX as their ""Best Sports Sedan"" TWO YEARS IN A ROW?""

 

If you got no money, it's fine.... but the TSX couldn't make this list any more than the Subarus could. The CTS-V is #1 at both Road & Track and Automobile.

 

""I'm not sure how this answers gbrozen's question but, I'm sure that with a $70,000 budget, someone could build a TL that's a competitive ""supercar.""

 

If if's and but's were candy and nuts, every day would be Christmas. Where's the CAR?

 

""BTW, when are you going to answer gbrozen's question and show us where ""people"" proclaimed the TL's superiority?""

did you forget the title of the topic? Apparently you did. How bout taking another look at the top of the board to remind yourself. The CTS-V, modified or not, is NOT an entry level luxo sports sedan. And, once again, NOTHING in this class is a supercar. Can it be made to perform like one with enough money? Of course. I can make a toaster beat the heck out of an M3 with enough money. But neither would fall into this category."

Just looked... and now you're telling me a CTS-V is not a CTS. Now that's absurd!! I suppose a 330i is also not a 3-Series? Different motor, sports packages are there also.

 

The barrier here has been price, but I've also shown how to get a CTS-V for less than many of the cars in this topic, even provided the link, so that's out the window. But hey, when you can't compete, you deny and say it doesn't fall into the category. Utter nonsense.

 

""Can it be made to perform like one with enough money? I can make a toaster beat the heck out of an M3 with enough money. But neither would fall into this category.""

 

Again, at the top of this category it says ""CTS"". The CTS-V is a CTS. You can get one for less than $40K. And to top it off, now you claim you can make a toaster perform like one with enough money, yet you produced neither the toaster, or the mythical car.

Quote from a website that townhall rules prohibit me from linking -

 

""The team had only ninety days to prepare a stock TL to NASA Honda Challenge specifications. While the engine, drivetrain and brake system remained stock, the team augmented the TL's 3.2 liter V6 with a cold air intake, and a custom exhaust header from Prototype Racing. A large diameter exhaust, a lightweight flywheel and a performance clutch were provided by Comptech USA. The suspension was modified with custom H&R coil-overs, a Progress adjustable rear sway bar and adjustable SPC camber ball joints and links. Lightweight Enkei racing wheels and Toyo RA-1 race compound tires were used for increased grip...""

 

That's a FWD luxury sedan with stock engine, drivetrain and brakes - and it finished 3rd in a 25-hour endurance race against Porsche's, BMW's, and Cobra's.

 

""The CTS-V is #1 at both Road & Track and Automobile.""

 

So what's that got to do with the $33,000 CTS (3.6L) we're talking about in this forum? The Saleen Cobra is an awesome car, but does that make the V-6 Mustang your sister drives a top-notch sport coupe?

 

Seriously, let's just leave the CTS-V (and that ridiculous, $120,000 Mallet) out of this discussion, OK?

 

In my opinion, the TL is a fine choice in this segment for someone who wants solid 8/10ths handling, a great engine/powertrain, and top quality materials and amenities. The CTS (again in my opinion) may offer 9/10ths handling, but in a package that is larger (it has the wheelbase of a Range Rover!), short on amenities, and has sub-par material quality and polarizing styling.

 

The bottom line is - both the Acura TL and Cadillac CTS are fine $33,000 choices. The ""better"" car is simply the one that possesses the characteristics that each of us value on an individual basis.

 

To dismiss the TL because of it's FWD layout is just as absurd as dismissing the CTS because of it's unconventioanl styling. If it's not your cup of tea, fine, but that doesn't make it inferior."

That a Mallet Caddy with 700+ HP finished 1st has absolutely no relevance to the TL, 3-Series or its own cousin, the CTS.

 

Please brush up on your automotive perspective. Kinda like comparing the Chevy Monte Carlo with its NASCAR 4th-cousin twice removed raced on Sunday's!!

 

Back to reality... the TL is certainly competitive to the G, 3-Series, CTS, etc... it just offers it's own distinct interpretation of the automotive experience to suit drivers that find those characteristics to be valuable. Good thing that variation exists to please ALL of us... competition also helps to improve the lot."
3058,cruller001,"January 10, 2005 9:40PM","Sup Folks,

 

Just finished reading the Bmw write-up in the Wall St Journal today. And to me, it seems they have just placed what has been known for a while in the public domain. Issues like Styling, I-Drive, reliability and competition, namely G35 and CTS(price?)was discussed in this article. I guess bimmer fans, and passive fans like myself and of course detractors have always known this to be the case, (we've certainly debated those same issues in these forums quite a bit).

 

 I certainly did not get the impression the article was mean to inflame. It pointed out Bmw sales were up world-wide. And in 2003 it made $3.5billion in profit, more than GM, Ford, Volkswagen, and Renault combined. However it's U.S market share had dropped due to these same issues and also changing demographics.

 

While I am passively in the market(I just paid off my 2000 Mazda Millennia S)If I decide to pull the trigger, M35sport, G35, TL and Jaguar would be my order of preference. As I pointed out earlier, while I am a passive fan, the price of the 3series and it's size simply don't do it for me.

I don't want to pay the $38k or so that I configured it for and I know that there are deals out there on GM vehicles. I read somewhere that somebody got $7,500 or so in rebates & incentives.

3067,gordonwd,"January 26, 2005 4:02PM","I always say ""what part of your car do you see the most of?"" Well, it's the interior -- not the exterior styling, and that has always been very important to me. That's one reason why my last two cars have been a '98 A4 and a '04 325i: both look and feel very nice from the driver's seat.

 

That is also one thing that turned me off when I test-drove a Saab 9-3 before deciding on the 325. The instrument panel of the Saab was very complex-looking -- dozens of buttons -- and with the display for the radio and that other display up under the windshield, it definitely didn't do it for me. I really like the external styling, and the car drove & performed well, but I couldn't see myself enjoying the view from the business seat!"
3068,billykrebs,"January 26, 2005 5:06PM","I have driven the TL, but not the CTS. Those really are the only 2 I can think of. The G is too small, 325 is too small, the A4 is too small, the 9-3 has gotten terrible reviews.

 

It appears that the CTS is just as big as the TL. I understand that the fit and finish is not as good in the CTS. I like the exterior styling of the CTS. One problem is that the Acura dealer is 60 miles away and the Cadillac dealer is 2 miles away. That is a big deal to me. I also am feeling pretty patriotic these days and am leaning to the CTS, a car i would of never looked at a year ago.

 

It really is tough. On paper the Acura wins and on the interior the Acura wins. I prefer the Caddy exterior to the TL exterior.

 

The Acura is cheaper on MSRP as well, but I am wondering if the street price of the CTS is probably much less than the MSRP. It has to be. So, a $38k CTS probably costs you $32k or so is what I am thinking. Does anyone here know?

 

I am looking to lease, not buy so that changes things a little bit."
3069,kyfdx,"January 26, 2005 5:19PM","1) If you like the CTS exterior, that counts for something..

 

2) 2 miles vs. 60 miles to the dealer is another real benefit..

 

3) The lease deals on TLs right now are just standard rates.. no manufacturer support.. So, maybe not that great.

 

4) Not sure of the lease deals on the CTS, but something tells me, that the price difference will pretty much disappear if you are leasing.. Maybe, even lower on the CTS.

3070,laurasdada,"January 26, 2005 5:58PM","Another thought, Billy. If winter driving is a consideration for you, then FWD vs. RWD may take on additional importance. Theoretically, FWD is better in the snow. HOWEVER, the non-navi TL is equipped with Bridgestone Turanza EL42 tires which, IMO, are terrible in the snow! Too bad I found this out after buying my TL, which other than the tires is a great car: smooth, quiet, powerful and handsome inside and out.

 

I've not been stranded (we're getting another 8-10"" on top of the 30"" of snow we got in Boston this weekend!) nor spun, but I think that is a combination of my snow driving experience and the TLs traction electronics (TC, VSA, ABS).

The doors are plastic, the dash is plastic, the console is plastic, the knobs are plastic, the middle console is plastic. For as much as I love the exterior I can't believe the inside is that bad. I am really dissapointed. I really thought that the reviews were exaggerating how bad it is. I am sorry to those CTS owners that I am offending but I truly am surprised and disappointed.

The G otoh has better handling (imo based on its RWD setup) but it comes with tougher ride. Well, it depends on your priorities thou. But if you choose a RWDer, dont forget to get winter tires (if you live in snow area). Believe me you wont regret it.

They could use the V6 VQ25DE used in the Japanese Fuga (U.S. M) 250GT, making 210hp at 6000rpm, and 197 torque at 4400rpm.

 

Obviously, it won't feel as powerful as the G35, but it will have a lighter steering feel, better balance, and be more gas efficient as well.

South of that line, the topography is very hilly, and even though this area gets less snow, it is much more difficult to navigate slick areas.. North of that line, most of the area is flat as a billiard table.. and, unless the snow is drifting, it really isn't that hard to navigate..

The issue gets a little murkier if the car has summer tires, for me, I'd get the snows.

 

I've spent the last dozen years on the east coast, and given the hilly nature of the local topology, winter tires become even more important. I survived with All-Season rubber in the NYC metro area, however, there were a number of days where I needed to be on the roads, and those tires made for a serious white knuckle trip.

Ultimately, you are correct.

This is one reason I've stuck with FWD and never felt the need for AWD. That's why I'm so disappointed with the Bridgestones' performance in the snow, I may need to buy snow tires! If I knew I was going to need snows, I may have gone RWD.

I was actually out in Columbus, Oh. just after Christmas and had no problems with the RS-A's even in water on top of ice (G35X).

Back here in NYC, I had no real problems in our recent ""blizzard"". The only time I was wishing for winter tires was when I was trying to park, or leave my parking space. I just turned on Snow Mode and turned off the VDC. A lot of rocking back and forth was required.

  I realize that all-season tires are at best a compromise. The AWD is best for getting going and helps in turns, but AWD doesn't do anything for stopping in the snow.

  I wish that the Infiniti wheels were not so expensive, as I would have a dedicated set of winter tires in the original size. I'd prefer Pirelli Sotto Zero or Dunlops, as I feel that they would last longer than Blizzaks. Too bad Nokkia or Gislaved don't make winter tires in this size."

I'd think the TL would be the slowest off-the-line b/c of the low-end torque, but, frankly, it's plenty-fast for me. With the manual, the clutch engages really early, so that might help (not sure). Overall, they're all fast. Since I don't live near an Autobahn-type road, the TL was the clear winner b/c of the luxury features. TL also got the best crash-test ratings, and I think consumer reports ranks it higher than the others.

As an aside, if you are even just considering navigation, go with the Acura and get it. The system is amazing - totally integrated with a/c and radio, so you can do a lot w/o taking your eyes off the road or hands off the wheel. Plus, if you know the phone number of your destination, you can program a route without your hands leaving the wheel. You can also use it instead of calling ""info"" - type in the store you want and it's name, address and phone # come up so you can call them. It's fantastic. One of those things you don't realize how neat it is until you have it."

With Automobile magazine recently rating the Subaru Legacy GT as the best family sedan. Also Road & Track picking the Legacy GT over the Acura TSX, can there be some reconsideration of adding the Subaru Legacy GT to this discussion. The size is about equal to the TL or the G35. The performance of the Legacy GT is equal or better. Safety measures & crash tests findings are equal. Quality fit & finish & interior materials are equal IMHO; that is subjective I understand, but they are much better than the last generation.
I think it warrants new consideration. The only thing missing is the NAV and the new 2006 will have that."

Here's my take on the 2005 Legacy GT. blueguydotcom, ""AWD MT Sedans - Subaru Legacy GT vs Others"" #35, 1 Mar 2005 12:02 pm

It got yanked yesterday because I used an acronym that is looked down upon here.

As for the S2000, intriguing but not really worth it as the performance from that engine is only marginally better than my 330i perf pack. And the car's not really useful/ Boxster - not to my liking in any way, shape or form - basically it's just heinous. 911's sweet but not my bag either. Too much like a middle aged man's Vette in my eyes. Pretty impractical too.

If I were to get a modder beater, it'd be a miata and then I'd turbo it.

Hey, see the new IS? Bland (but styling's pretty unimportant to me) but the possibility of the 3.5 with 300 hp, RWD, lower driving position and lexus reliability, gets my eyebrows up. I'm hoping I've finally found something that can at least run with my E46 and not make pine for it."
3116,blueguydotcom,"March 3, 2005 11:25PM","Chris, nice to see you. And no I don't hate the G35. Far from it. Excellent car that isn't quite there.

Regarding seating, lowering the seat would only make me like I'm sitting in a hole and it won't change the fact the car is so damn high.

As for handling - please tell me you'll drive the sport model next time. No one complains in fact the 03 had .9 skidpad and 67 slalom (or 66.5 maybe can't remember) - not exactly lumbering.

Drove a G35 manual 05 which comes with the 18s. AFAIK, the manuals come with the sport suspension automatically. If i'm wrong, please correct me. I believe I'm right though (remember I wanted to buy an 03).

For a car the runs with - and not behind the 3 with ZHP pack - sporty sedan is just plain WRONG. You must have been owned by a G some time ago and have a bad thing for them now. You've been trshing them for over a year while the rest of the automotvie community respects that there is a new benchmark until 06 at least.

Owned how? I don't race people. I was owned by a G35 03 on a test drive - the car lifted up in the rear on a turn. Unsettling to say the least. IMHO, and it's just my opinion (thought other seem to agree), the G35 does not feel as centered or planted on the tarmac as the 330i zhp. Trust me, I wanted to buy an 03 and I desperately wanted to love the 05 G35. But the car's handling and engine just didn't match my expectations for a car in this class. I would love to be in a reliable, fast, competent, japanese sports sedan (not to mention cheap!). But I can't find one!"
3117,blueguydotcom,"March 3, 2005 11:28PM","And the 06 330 swill seem sluggish compared to a 298hp G for sure. And that crappy handling will be just enough to match anything the 3 has..with more legroom.

Uh, I haven't touched the 06 3 so I won't comment on the performance. Though I will say I think the body is ugly, interior bland and the size increase totally unwarranted. The e46 was already too porky (not just in weight but also size), so the e90 will get a coutesy test drive when i replace my car but I have very low expectations for the car. And for BMW in general.

BTW, my 330i with its measely 235 hp, still pulls perfectly and with no fanfare compared to my experience in the 05 G35. The inline 6 in my ZHP may not be my favorite engine but god, it's so smooth it makes me wonder how Subaru and Infiniti even try to compete with those engines. The racket in the highend is insane."

3119,vanhalenabe,"March 4, 2005 12:00AM","** Also posted this on the Infiniti G35 Sedan and FX35 boards**

Hi everyone, this is my first post on this board. To give you a little background, I currently own a Mazda MX-6 and my wife drives an Acura MDX. We have a 14 month baby girl, and it is getting very difficult for me to get her in and out of the car seat, if I have to pick her up.

So, I'm in the market for a new vehicle. I had wanted to stay with a manual transmission -- I don't have traffic in my commute and prefer the fun and feel of a manual transmission.

Anyway, I had narrowed the choice down to the Acura TL 6MT and the Infiniti G35 Sedan with 6MT. After weighing all of the pros and cons, I decided to go with the G35.

Then came the baby car seat test, in which the G35 did not do well. The TL has a latch position in the center, so you can place a rear-facing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions. The G35 does not have this.

I then tried to put the rear-facing car seat behind the drivers seat and the passengers seat. Even with the seats adjusted to my short 5'8"" frame, I found that I had to move the seats too far forward in the G35. The Acura was a tiny bit better in this regard. Since my heart was set on the G35, I was very disappointed in this.

We only have one child now, but hope to have a second one in the future. Meaning that we will probably have both a forward facing toddler seat and a rear facing infant seat in the back. So, I really need a vehicle that can accomodate both.

This brings me to small SUV's. I test drove both the Infiniti FX35 and the Lexus RX330. The Lexus is more practical, but I really prefer the looks and sporty feel of the FX35. I preferred the control and feel of the FX35 sport suspension, with the 20"" wheels, even though the ride was a tad harsher. I live in Dallas, and a RWD car with big wheels will rarely have weather issues to contend with.

I would appreciate any advice, especially with regards to the baby car seats, that would help me make my decision. If there are any parents of young children out there that have faced a similar problem recently, I would appreciate your input.

I have checked out the Infiniti Snugkids website, but it does not say anything about how to put a car seat in the center position.

One thought is to go with the my first choice, the G35. The problems with the infant car seat will only be for the first couple of years. After which the baby will be in a forward-facing car seat that the G35 can easily accomodate. Do I rule out my #1 choice just because of a car seat? Like I said, I was very disappointed when the G35 did not do well with the car seats. I'm beginning to think that all mid-size sedans will have this problem.

Sorry for the long email. Thanks."

My 3 kids are now 8, 6, and 3, so I'm just a few years beyond you. We own an Odyssey and just bought an 05 TL 6MT. One key for us was enough width across the back seat for the 3 kids, 2 of them in booster seats. Narrowed to Nissan Maxima (slightly more room) and TL because we felt most of the other contenders in this category would be too small. So far we're very pleased with our choice. Getting the kids in and out of the back is not as easy as in the van, but still not a problem. BTW they love the DVD surround sound in the Acura and fight over who gets next. I didn't drive the Infinity, d/t the perception it wasn't quite as big as the other 2.

More importantly, though, I'm concerned about your comment as follows:

""The TL has a latch position in the center, so you can place a rear-facing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions.""

I have an '04 TL and use a car seat, as I did with my prior 2001.5 Passat, and I don't think there is a center latch set in the Acura. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE count the number of latches. I believe you'll find 4, and even though it is possible to attach the seat in the middle, you'll be doing so using the inside passenger-side latch and the inside driver-side latch. Latches are not tested this way. They are intended to have pressure applied to the same set of latches. So please, make sure you find a car with 6 latches in the back if you want to latch in the center."
3122,vanhalenabe,"March 4, 2005 7:18PM","ljwalters1 -- Thanks for the comment about the number of latches. I was looking at the 05 TL and I am pretty sure there are 3 pairs of latches in the back.

3123,djocks,"March 4, 2005 10:23PM","I was fortunate enough to drive a 2005 g35 6mt for a few days and it was so interesting to me how I walked away from it. I was very strongly considering buying the car as a replacement to my 2003 330i as it is bigger and a little more family friendly. Here is my opinion.

1. I know the g35 is faster on paper but it sure does not feel faster. I guess it has to do with the overall size of the car. But the BMW simply felt like it had more pop.

2. I do admit the G has the bimmer beat in some areas. Back seat, stereo, and you can even argue it has a more modern look.

3. But I am here to tell you that everything people say about BMW's is absolutely correct. The biggest difference for me was behind the wheel and the connection you have with your surroundings and the road. It is truly amazing to me.

So in conclusion I decided to stay in my 2003 330i and wait to see the 06 3-series.

The funniest thing to me was I walked away thinking that it is either a BMW or it is not. And I will look again in time at the g35 and the new lexus IS but in the end I believe that if I do not get a BMW I am going to load up a Honda Accord and be Mr. family guy.

When I drove the two cars back to back (auto), the G definitely felt faster. And that was with the 260hp 2003 G35. The 280hp 2005 G35 should be even faster.

The G is simply a bigger sedan than the 3. That alone works against it in terms of handling."

PS - putting the carseat behind the passenger seat is better than the middle for ease of getting the baby in/out, and with rear-facing seats, it's easier for my hand to touch my baby - the middle position is actually too close for me. I find the middle position is only nice (1) if there'll be 2 small people sitting in the back, too, or (2) on long trips when the baby can better enjoy looking out the front window with a front-facing seat, or (3) there'll be someone in the front passenger seat and the middle position is easier for them."

I wouldn't be so sure of that. A FWD car gets better traction b/c the engine sits over the wheels that drive, and that weight provides increased traction - probably due to increased friction with the road (don't know if there are studies on that). TCS does not increase traction - it just makes the best use of whatever traction is there by increasing the drive power of whichever wheel has traction. It can't create traction, which the fwd car does b/c of the engine placement. I would thing a fwd car would generally be better than rwd w/ TCS."

But in all honesty, this car is the only car that has out right left me and my TLS in the dust.
So I crossed enemy lines on Saturday just to get a taste of what this car feels like.

I went to the local BMW dealer and test the 545- with the sport package.
I was blown away, this car is fast and I mean fast on every aspect of the rev-band.
It was surprising to me that the dealer let me go on the test drive all by myself.I went there back in 99 when I was cross shopping the 3, TL and the Millennia and they wanted to put a traking device on the car

3140,shipo,"March 7, 2005 6:57PM","""Traction is traction, whether it's off the line, cruising or in a turn...""

Well, no, not really. Static weight distribution (ie. front/rear weight bias) and driving dynamics play a substantial part in winter driving as well.

Three examples (assuming two otherwise identical FWD and RWD cars driving in snowy conditions):

Acceleration: under light acceleration (ie. very little front to rear weight transfer), the FWD car, with its ~60/40 weight distribution will have more traction than the RWD car with its ~50/50 weight distribution. However, under stronger acceleration, since weight transfers to the rear in such a situation, the front tires will lose traction whereas the RWD car will gain traction.

Around a curve: the lighter back end of the FWD car will come unglued before the heavier front end of the car under some circumstances, while in others (accelerating through a curve for instance), since the front tires are being asked to do double duty (accelerating and turning), they will break loose (and plow) before the back end. A RWD car with a good traction control system will be less prone to either of those two scenarios.

Braking: The FWD car, which already has a significant front end bias, will load up even more with the weight transfer of braking, allowing the back end to become very light and lose traction, and without the aid of TCS, could very well find said back end leading the front end down the road. The RWD car, given its better balance will be less susceptible to that situation as well.

Shipo"
3141,qbrozen,"March 7, 2005 7:00PM","No, I haven't tried winter tires. But, to answer your second question, I have to extrapolate that, since my RWD car has the worst traction while NONE of my cars have winter tires, it would still have the worst traction if ALL of my cars had winter tires. It may no longer be dangerous, but it would still suffer by comparison.

Regardless, I just don't want to spend the money and time, at this point, to buy special tires and change them depending on the weather. I kept my FWD car so that I can leave the RWD car at home when necessary.

Now, let's keep in mind that not all Traction/Stability systems are created equal. I found the system in the Benz to be FAR more capable (and far more transparent) than the system in my 350Z.

I must say that the TCS system on my 530i is quite impressive, and coupled with the additional winter tires (I ordered the Sport Package which includes summer tires), my car has gone from completely un-drivable in anything more than a dusting of snow to being able to easily plow through six inches as quickly as (if not quicker than) the ubiquitous SUVs that many here in southern New Hamster drive. Given that we are in the midst of our second one hundred inch or more winter in the last three seasons, I've had ample opportunity to drive with four to six inches on the roads.

Winter tires are a marginal expense ( your summer tires will last longer because they are ""resting"" 1/2 the year ). It's a LOT cheaper than buying/maintaining/insuring two cars.

I don't understand this incredible aversion so many people have to winter tires. If you live in a snowy area it's a better safety investment than FWD, AWD, airbags, stability control, and all the other things car companies have convinced us to spend money on.

3146,qbrozen,"March 7, 2005 9:18PM","i hear what you're saying, but, in my case, I didn't buy another car. I just didn't sell one. Besides, not only am I saving the miles on my summer tires on the Z, but I'm saving miles off the entire car by driving a different one altogether.

Maintenance costs nothing extra because the miles are split between the cars, so I'm still doing maintenance at the same pace if you count performing it half as much on twice the cars.

Insurance? Eh, not enough to worry about. $40 a month is worth it for me, especially when you figure in the added bonus of being able to keep a 2-seat sportscar on hand while still having the 4-seat sedan for familial duties (whereas many many people sacrifice the sportscar because they had a baby or whatever). EDIT ... OH, and a whole other set of tires and wheels would cost me probably nearly the same as 2 years of insurance on that 2nd car.

Notice I mentioned TIME and money. Obviously, money isn't the big issue with me. Time (and something else I forgot - garage storage space for those extra wheels/tires) is.

As a counterpoint to that statement, I have leased two BMWs, and in both cases I was quoted a lower monthly lease price from an non BMW-FS leasing outfit.

In October 2005:
'06 IS250 and IS350. The IS250 will have a 6 speed manual tranny OR a automatic V6 engine. The IS250 will have 220 horsepower. The IS350 is a V6 automatic ONLY, but will have guarranteed minimum of 325 horsies. The IS350 will have an available ""Sport Package"" with ""18 wheels. Pricing will remain competitive and the IS will start around $32k-$33k, same as what we have now, but a top of the line will be about $45k.

In March 2006:
'07 ES350 will have a 3.5 liter engine with a completely new body style. The only thing they are keeping the same on the ES will be the headlight design.

In April 2006:
'07 RX350 will have the same updated engine as the ES

In May 2006:
GS450Hybrid will have a V6 hybrid engine, but be faster than the GS430.

In September 2006:
LS460Hybrid with 2 body styles, one 6 inches longer, will be added to the regular LS. Both will have 4.6 V8 engines.

In September 2006:
'07GS350 will have the updated engine, but same body style.

In September 2006:
'07 GS460 will have an updated engine.

In 2-3 more years the IS convertible with retractable hard top is coming for cetain. And other car ideas that are being tossed around also are the ""Super LS"" that will cost more than $100k and the ""SuperCoupe"" that will go 200 MPH.

------------------

Also, it seems that Toyota is going to use the 3.5 GR V6 in much the same fashion that Nissan uses the 3.5 VQ V6, meaning that a lot Toyotas/Lexuses will have it. No doubt the next Camry, Solara, Sienna, and Highlander will carry the 3.5 GR as well."

One big reason is that, in search of better economy, emissions, and performance, the trend is toward more gears. Even the latest automatics now have 6 speeds. However, the consensus is that 6 speeds is the practical limit for a manual lever-shifted transmission. Think about trying to negotiate the gates quickly with a theoretical 7-speed shifter and you'll see what I mean :-).

But this does not mean a future of driving slush-boxes! There is already a trend toward the sequential-shift transmissions that BMW calls ""SMG"" and I forget what Audi calls theirs. Internally these are fully ""manual"" type gearboxes with mechanical clutches, but they're shifted electronically under servo control and don't have a clutch pedal.

To me these seem to be the worst of both worlds, but unfortunately that's what we're headed for a few years down the road. So enjoy using your clutch pedal while you can; I know I will!"

3192,shipo,"March 11, 2005 6:35PM","BillHerrMann,

If you had actually read my post you would see that I explained why it wasn't a fair comparison. Your former 330xi is a car that is running around with AWD hardware, and said hardware is both heavy and has a certain amount of mechanical drag associated with it. That makes the 330xi significantly slower and less responsive than a like equipped 330i. The CTS 3.6 has a RWD drive train which (like the 330i) is much more efficient, so no, it wasn't a fair comparison. To make it fair, you would need to compare it to a RWD 330i. As if the AWD components weren't enough of a handicap, the 330xi only comes equipped with (relatively) skinny All-Season tires, which are not at all conducive to good handling. IMHO it isn&#146;t even fair to compare a 330i SP to a 330xi, they just ain't the same.

Since the lease is up on my 530i SP in a couple of weeks, and since I am going to hold off from getting a new car for a year or so, I've been taking the time to test drive virtually every thing out there, including a CTS 3.6 (automatic, no dealership around here stocks cars with manual transmissions, assuming of course that you can even order one these days). It was quick, however, not as quick as my 530i 5-Speed, which by the way is no match for a 330i 6-Speed. As for handling, sorry, the CTS felt like a land barge compared to my 530i, which once again, isn't in the same league as a 330i SP.

Regarding trunk space; who cares? We are talking Performance Sedans here, and like it or not, trunk space is not something high on the priority list of most folks shopping for this type if car. Will the 330i hold three bags of golf clubs? Yes. Good enough!

Regarding the pricing numbers you've been throwing around, me thinks you're playing it a little loose. I configured both cars as follows (which is how I would order them were I going to do so today):

Cadillac CTS Luxury Sport: $41,385
BMW 330i, PP, SP, Xenon, Heated Front Seats: $40,995

The only option that the CTS has that the 330i doesn't have is the UGO, which is an after market accessory costing $145. In the end, those two cars are as Apples to Apples as it gets, and the BMW costs a whopping $245 less. Sorry, I cannot get too excited about the price difference. What I can get excited about is the difference in how they DRIVE (note, not just how they accelerate), and in that comparison, the Cadillac finished a very distant second.

Enjoy your CTS.

Would you purchase that 330i again? I'm currently a TSX owner (which I love, BTW), but that darn bimmer intrigues me to no end.

In the Seattle area, the BMW is absolutely ubiquitous, but I still want to drive and maybe buy one someday.

What are your thoughts regarding the TSX V. 330i? I thought I'd read some of your posts indicating you'd driven the TSX.

Thanks for any input."

I also brought two ads from dealers in Boston and Cincinnati and told the dealers that other dealers were willing to sell the car to me for less.

And this strategy worked because I bought an I35 and many dealers are looking to get rid of their leftover cars from last year."

3210,blueguydotcom,"March 12, 2005 10:57PM","Johnny,

I love the TSX. I can't quite explain its appeal. I love the clean style, the nice, simple, legant cockpit but more importantly, I go ga-ga for the silky smoth 6 speed in those things. Like buddah. I've driven them a few times and I always dug the eager pull of the engine, the delight of keeping the car over 4k rpm with plenty of room to play.

The 330i is a pretty different beast. The driving dynamics matched with the power won me over. If you feel like your TSX just isn't there for power, and if you'd like that special punch in corners of RWD then you'll enjoy the 330i. Really, the only way you'll know, go drive one. And let the salesguy know it's all about the handling. In other words don't let him take you on some anemic on surface street, then the freeway and back test drive. You want twists, turns, hills, switchbacks and plenty of opp to flog the car as god intended.

Yes, BMWs on the west coast are everywhere! you can't swing a dead cat in any west coast major city without hitting a bimmer. Unfortunate but true - one my reason the TSX attracts me.

If I hadn't run across a 330i with manual to drive in 03, I'm sure I woulda ended up in a TSX. I woulda been fairly happy too. Just yearned for more power and AWD/RWD.

Knowing what I know now about my 330i would I lease again...hmmm. Most likely yes but I gotta say I'd dwell on it way more. I would probably still lease. I really wish I could own a BMW, but I simply don't think they're good cars. All this talk about the 08 M3 4 door has me excited and conflicted. You just can't lease an M3, it's a car you buy and keep. And the idea of buying a BMW troubles me. The idea of owning a lexus, infiniti, mazda, acura doesn't raise my eyebrow in the least."

They also estimated a 0-60 time beating the 330i by a full second since the IS350 will have 300hp under the hood.

Indeed, they all have porcine characteristics. I saw an E23 7-series (first generation) this morning near a current 530. The 7 actually looked smaller and was certainly lower. Maybe the Porsche Panamera will bring everyone back to their senses. You can bet it will be low slung the way a sport sedan should be. However, if the engine goes up front it may run into a problem…

I think one of the problems is the new pedestrian safety regs which, among other things, require a certain amount of clearance between the hood and the engine. When the hood height gets raised, so does the rest of the car which may account for the slab-sidedness we&#146;ve been seeing. It certainly appears as if the E90 and new IS conform to these regs, in addition to the other new generations."

3232,151ranch,"April 3, 2005 10:23PM","as my 95 850T appears to be ready for the junkyard. I can probably go a few months if they can figure out the fuel delivery problem since the engine/tranny are still in good shape but at 190k it won't be long.

My priorities are: manual transmission, speed, handling, safety and decent gas mileage. Price range is 40k or less, and am willing to buy late model used. DH says no Volvo, MB or VW. I am willing to give Volvo another chance.

I test drove the 5 series (530) and the 3 series (330xi and 330) last week, but there was no manual tranny available!!? Was not impressed - the slush box made my Volvo AT seem great and both cars were rather loud - the 3 series in a good exhaust way, the 5 series in a bad road noise way. The manual shift option was incredibly slow. I will try to test drive again at another dealer (for the manual). P.S. I-drive stinks.

Was hopeful about the TL but having a hard time getting over the sheer craziness of the Navi/Voice control system and the dash lights were very glaring at night. I am not THAT old and am even some what of a computer geek but someone needs to tell these car companies to stop with all the #%@) junk in the interior.

So what's left:

S70
TSX
Maxima
GS
CTS - well, I don't think DH will go for this either

Wait for new IS?

Their interiors may not be up to BMW quality. But their drivetrain is every bit as good. The Forester XT Premium for example, can't hold a candle amenity wise to any car in this thread, but it will go to 60 in 5.25 seconds and it costs $15K less than the 330. The $15K one could save could be invested in another car, the market, your house...etc. So yes, the compromise is in the interior, but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter, engine or drivetrain.

While you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30. Show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 5.25 seconds, like the Forester XT(see review in caranddriver.com ) and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway."
3245,blueguydotcom,"April 15, 2005 3:33PM","So yes, the compromise is in the interior, but there is no compromise with the smoothness of the shifter, engine or drivetrain.

Absolutely, 100% disagree. The engine, shifter and tranny are rough, unrefined, loud and fill me with anything but confidence in the car's abilities.

While you might be right about the gas mileage running within legal limits will bump the gas mileage to about 30. Show me any car that goes 0 to 60 in 5.25 seconds, like the Forester XT(see review in caranddriver.com ) and gets 30 mpg going 80 on the freeway.

The Scooby XT won't get 30 mpg running 80 mph. According to Edmunds the 2005 xt manual is rated at 23-24 mpg for the freeway. The engine runs to high in the rpm to approach that feat. And at 90 mph, I know it won't come even close to 24. Turbo 4s are fun but not economical when matched to lousy gearing.

Scoobies are fun but they're not on the level of entry lux cars by any stretch."

3247,kdshapiro,"April 15, 2005 4:04PM","Actually I couldn't disagree more. The shifter is snappy and crisp, the suspension is taut, and the car takes off like greased lightning. Faster than any other car in this thread. It holds the road on par with the FX35/X3. I agree it does not have the amenities and the vehicle does have a numb spot in the steering. But it begs for more, and you can give it more and it inspires the same confidence as the 3er. And it cost $10K++ less than the other vehicles in this board.

I agree, you give up some. The interior of the Scooby isn't up to the interior quality of these vehicles. But you pay less, get less amenities but more drive.

As for the gas mileage, in this part of the country you don't fly around at 80, unless you want a big fat ticket so I'm not worried. But people I know who have the car get 27+ doing around 65 and that's just fine with me. And did I mention it cost less than the other vehicles in this segment.

I'm not promoting the vehicle nor do I really believe it belongs in this thread, IMHO, it has the guts to compete with these other fine cars at a different level. Maybe less luxury and amenities, but it will blow the doors off of them. To some people that's important, to others it's not. There is no right or wrong. YMMV."

I started my search looking at TLs, TSXes, and G35s. Then the Scottish hertitage kicked in and I asked myself why should I pay $30K+ for my 8 mile city commute. I just couldn't rationalize it. I ended up with a Camry SE-V6. Not as luxurious as the the TL or ES330 (although same powertrain as the latter), not as fast as the G35, not sporty as the BMW but for me, the marginal utility of that extra $7-10,000 just wasn't there.

But for what it is, silky smooth shifter, power galore with the turbo, taut suspension, spacious cross-over, 5.3 to 60, LSD and $$$ less than an X3, it's a perfect vehicle for some. Heck, it'll blow past an FX45. Can you tell I had a blast driving it? The cabin noise from the windup of the turbo is right on the money. Although it clearly does not belong in the entry level segment, as the amenities are not up to others in the segment, it's a lot of bang for the buck.

And finally for those who dwell on such things, it's reliable and it got the IIHS best pick. Comparing it against a 330, no it's not all that, but you know what it's $15K less. And Subaru scrimped in the amenities, not the engine, handling or drivetrain."
3259,jcj1,"April 20, 2005 5:37AM","I need to make a purchasing decision in the next few days. I have narrowed the field down to two: an Infiniti G35 RWD Sedan or a Subaru Legacy GT LTD Wagon. I can get either car for $500 over invoice via the Costco program, and the two cars are within a couple of hundred dollars of each other with the options I want.

For the G35, I opt for RWD because I live in the California where there is no real need for AWD. I'd go with the AT because I feel the G35 accelarate more smoothly with the AT, while the 6MT is a bit notchy and also less practical for my daily commute.

For the Subaru, I opt for the Wagon because I love the oversize sunroof and the wagon is a bit roomier and also looks a bit nice (my personal opinion). Unfortunately the AT does not work well with the 2.5 Turbo in the Subaru, and the 5MT with STi short throw shifter and Momo shift knob is so much fun to drive that it reminds me of a Mazda Miata. So I think I'd go with the MT for the Subaru.

Now the questions:

1) My wife is a bit concerned about the durability of turbo engine as we plan to keep our car for a long time (We kept our last two cars for 10-15 years). Is this a good enough reason to stay away from the Subaru?

2) How is the predicted reliability of Subaru compared to Infiniti? This is our No. 1 priority. So far we only have experience with Honda and Toyota which have been pretty much trouble free. Can I expect the same level of quality and reliability from Subaru or Infiniti/Nissan?

3) Is $500 over invoice a good price for these cars? Is it worth bargaining for a price that is significantly better than Costco's?

Your help is most appreciated. Thanks!"
3260,kdshapiro,"April 20, 2005 12:52PM","Some thoughts:

1. cars with turbos in the long run are probably less problem free than cars without. In 15 years, who can tell what the reliability of a turbo car is? But in 15 years, what will be the reliability of the G35?

2. You can get a lot of reliability information from the annual car buyers issue of consumer reports. You can read the Subaru and Infiniti forums for some insight as to the types of issues people are experiencing.

3. I would starting negotiating under invoice and work my way up, rather than to work my way down.

Good luck"
3261,gordonwd,"April 20, 2005 1:21PM","In 7 years of ownership, the only major out-of-pocket expense on my A4 1.8T was a turbo-related repair that cost me about $600. So take that for what it's worth. But it is one reason why I downgraded the Saab 9-3 as a replacement for the A4: I just didn't want another turbo for long-term ownership (ended up with a 325i). Look under the hood and you'll see a lot of extra plumbing, sensors, controls, etc. that are related to the turbo. And the thought of something in there spinning at 20K RPM for years and years makes me cringe ."
3262,shipo,"April 20, 2005 2:30PM","Back in the 1980s when Chrysler was the largest producer of turbocharged engines in the world, I had not one but two of their cars. Both were running strong at 100,000 miles when I traded them in, and I had no doubt that they would have continued to provide me with excellent service had I decided to keep them. Having said that, within my immediate sphere of family and friends, there were five other Mopar turbos that I was aware of, and each one of them required a turbo replacement within the first 75,000 miles (one needed two turbo replacements). The only difference that I could figure was that while we all followed the standard maintenance plan, I used Mobil-1 while the rest of them used whatever oil their dealership happened to use.

I switched to Mobil-1 from Castrol-GTX when I got my first turbo simply because I'd heard of bearing issues due to the oil being coked when the oil supply was abruptly cut off from the hot/high speed turbine bearings at engine shutdown. I reasoned that the Synthetic oil would be much more capable of resisting coking, and while my sampling of two isn't definitive, it was enough to cause me to use nothing but Mobil-1 in every car I've had since then.

3263,gordonwd,"April 21, 2005 2:22PM","And on my A4 turbo they had a recommended oil-change interval of 5000 miles vs. 7500 miles for the 3.0 V6 model of the same car. Even with that, I heard that there were some issues with engine problems caused by the coking up of the oil if it was not changed on time or a substandard grade was used. I got a letter from Audi regarding this a few months after I had sold the car. Fortunately, I sold it to a friend of mine down the street, so was able to pass on the warning to him."

3265,potemkin,"April 23, 2005 4:50PM","Here's my two cents: I test drove two '05 C230's back in November. One was a sport coupe with an automatic. The other was a sport sedan w/6 speed manual. I drove the auto first* and was dismayed by the noticeable lag on take off. The 6 speed, on the other hand, had no noticeable lag and I couldn't tell the difference between it and a normally aspirated six. As far as the shifter goes, it was silky smooth, quick and short. The road holding was good, but a little softer than I'm used to (though not as soft as MB's reputation for a soft ride).

* I had no intention of buy an automatic, it's just that they didn't have any sticks on the lot when I went looking.

You're welcome.

P.S.: For what it's worth, I wound up buying a '05 325i ZSP in January. Never drove the A4 -- I have an aversion to FWD."
3266,twodogjohnny,"April 24, 2005 2:46PM","I just sold my 04 WRX, and got an 05 G35X.
The WRX is something like 227hp, the legacy is 250hp with half a litre more displacement.
4cyl vs. 6cyl: you are going to be reving that subaru above 3k to keep it in the powerband. The low end is real hard to find with the subaru.
The subaru manual transmission is like shifting a tractor.

I always felt like I was racing and working hard while driving the WRX. I just push the pedal and cruise along with the G35. Power is always there when you need it.

3267,kdshapiro,"April 25, 2005 2:09AM","I understand and am not debating that point. I was only pointing out that after a test drive or two I understand why there is almost a cult like following for the cars. They are not entry level luxos. But the drivetrain is beyond reproach and the shifter is silky smooth.

The Forester for example was clocked at 5.3 to 60 by C&D with only 210 hp. Like the Bimmers these cars are sleepers. But again I realize the luxury factor is not up to their bigger cousins."
3268,gordonwd,"April 25, 2005 1:28PM","That's the ""problem"" with getting into the luxury segment: you get spoiled by all the features that you did quite well without when you didn't know about them . Two cars ago I owned a Sentra SE-R that I thought was a really great car -- sort of the early 90's equivalent to the WRX in being a pocket-rocket, sleeper type of compact car. When I got my A4, I suddenly woke up to all the features that I didn't have in the Sentra: power windows, climate control, great stereo, and on and on.

Now I don't think I can go back to what now seems like a stripped-down car like the Sentra, and in retrospect even my A4 seems like it was lacking compared to my 325i (how did I ever get along without memory power seats?? ). And I just read a road test the other day of a car in this segment, and the reviewer knocked it down because it had heated seats but no heated steering wheel, if you can believe that!"
3269,kdshapiro,"April 25, 2005 3:04PM","I agree 98%. After living with a 3 series for a few years, I got very spoiled. I like the extra luxo stuff, no doubt. However, I realized the loaded Outback would be quite acceptable to me as would the Forester XT premium. I do want the power this, power that, heated this and automatic that and leather.

I found out don't *need* a premium brand and I can gracefully step down the luxo factor, and still like the car.

With the additional requirement for more cars in the family I'm thinking through the difference between what is wanted and what is needed."
3270,ljwalters1,"April 25, 2005 3:25PM","I, too, love the luxury features :shades: , and determine which car I get more by those features than the brand. With my VW, the ""coolest"" lux feature (that I miss very much ) is rain-sensing windshield wipers. Certainly I'm fine with the regular, Hi, Low, Intermittent, but it's great having wipers that change automatically w/o my having to adjust them. Speed sensing comes close, but no cigar! The most annoying lux feature on my VW was the redundant radio controls. 1- they operated as a ""seek"" button, as opposed to scrolling through the presents, which was quite annoying. 2- they were on the right-hand side of the steering wheel. For some reason, I really like those controls on the left. If I want to use my right-hand, the dash isn't much farther away!

With my current car ('04 TL), the top luxury feature is the voice-recognition nav system, that's integrated to receive voice commands for the radio and the climate control system. Totally unnecessary, as I can now change the radio stations by using the standard controls, the controls on the steering wheel or my voice), but totally fun!

For all you feature buffs out there with heated seats - they're pretty good for keeping your take-out food warm on the drive home. Kind of like a built-in sterno-flame!!!

Anyone else have some favorite/hated lux features to share?"

Even with adjustable intermittent wipers, I was always changing the adjustment to match the current amount of rain... The rain-sensing wipers work so well, they seem connected directly to my brain... Sometimes I don't even realize they are on..

Memory power seats... If your car has two drivers, this is a great feature.. 10-way power seats are a pain, if you have to readjust them and find your ""spot"".. With the memory, I just push one button before I get in, and it is right where I want it.

I'd insist on them even if I was the only driver. Why? Have you ever spent the time to get your 8, 10 or even 12 way manual sport seats adjusted just so, only to need to valet park your car? I've done it entirely too many times (like 2-3 times per week for nearly 12 years), and it seems like three out of every four times when I'd reclaim my car, the parking valets had somehow managed so mess with every single adjustment knob, lever and handle, forcing me to spend half of the trip home constantly focusing my attention on adjusting the &#$*!@^%&; seat, instead of on the traffic surrounding me.

One could also make the assertion you get 120% the performance with 50% of the luxo value at 75% of the price. (I don't know if that averages out to better value than the Bimmer or not :blush: )

True, true. I'm all over the place with what i want. I want a hatch, a convertible, a sedan. Hmm. That's why I'm seriously considering an A3 or Mazdaspeed3 and then pick up a used Miata or Z4 a year or two down the road. Or if BMW will confirm a 130, then get a simple convertible for a year or two and the 130 will join it eventually."
3287,esf,"April 26, 2005 1:59AM","About your new car considerations- If you want an A3, you may have to wait like half a year for the 3.2 version, which is the one that would really have you pick it over the Mazda in performance. The 2.0T just isn't powerful enough to compete with that. Also, the 3.2 is supposed to have the DSG transmission from the TT 3.2, but neither A3s are supposed to have quattro until next year. And, BMW isn't giving us the 1 Series. The 1 Series is the Europe and Asia-only hatch. America is getting the 2 Series, a tiny coupe and convertible model. But, you're not going to be able to get it until like 2008. It's still developing. About the A3 again, if you want your car soon, and have the $, maybe you could spring for the S4 Avant instead, and have more performance, luxury and equal style for a bigger price tag. This is because that the 3.2 isn't coming soon. Or, if you can't afford that, look at the A4 Avant or Sedan 3.2. It's supposed to really fly! Anyway, BMW already did confirm a 130i, and it's already on sale in other parts of the world. It's the 230i you want.

Also, I don't know how long you can wait, but the next TT is supposed to be a major rocket. It's going to have an Audi Alluminum Space Frame, and it's going to also have the next generation Audi/Volkswagen V6: A 3.6 V6, first being used in the upcoming Passat, is going to generate some 280 horses, and that's not all. Audi is going to make a TTS, supposedly with the 340 horsepower V8 from the S4 (If it can fit), and a TT RS, but I don't know what that monster is gonna have. It should give the Porsche Boxster S and the Mercedes SLK 55 AMG a major heads-up. Or, they'll eat its dust if they don't put the 911 engine in the Boxster and make an SLK 63 AMG!"

The 1 series is in Mexico right now...Mexico's not in Asia or Europe last time I checked. In fact last weekend a friend saw a 1 series at Fashion Valley Mall here in San Diego. It had Baja Mex plates on it.

So you might want to amend that statement.

S4 Avant = big fat, lazy pig. That thing weighs nearly 2 tons (3957 to be exact)! If i wanted something fast I'd just keep my 330i ZHP. The 2.0 is under 30k nicely optioned and it gets 31 mpg v. 21 mpg. Take the extra 20k and go buy a used Miata and mod it to the high heavens.

Bzzzzt! I'm sorry, that's not correct!

Audi and VW are not using the same engine. Audi is wedded to a true V6 as it is shorter and is able to be mounted longitudinally and still allow for a nice installation for AWD. VW is reverting back to a VR6 design for the new Passat, with is a longer mill, requiring a transverse installation and an AWD system similar in nature to what the Audi TT has sported for a few years.

3295,djocks,"May 26, 2005 5:07PM","I am coming off the lease of a 03 330i and I have been shopping a great deal in the recent months.

I like many on this board am in need of a family friendly sedan (4 doors) that will serve primarily as a commuter for me. I drive about 50 miles a day.

I thought for a while that I would like the G35(6MT), but after driving one for almost a day I was not a fan with the way the car set up. The interior had maxima written all over it (to be honest, it is the interior they should've put in the maxima). The performance was strong and obviously fast but it did not possess the crisp feeling of my 330i. So the G35 became an after thought. (I will speak more on it later)

So now it is going to come down to the TL v BMW.

I had the honor of taking out the new 06 325i (6-MT) yesterday and a tip of the hat to everyone waiting for one. I know what the horsepower says, and I can read the 0-60 times but I say without hesitation that the new 325i absolutely rips the G35 and TL apart. It feels as fast as my present 330i and the driving experience is actually improved. It is truly another typical BMW ""how do they do that?"" experiences. And after driving the 3 cars, anyone who says the G35 or TL is close to the 325i is saying that because that is what they have in their garage. I am coming at you honestly b/c I am leaning towards the TL, but the fun factor of driving the 325i is not even measurable. It truly is a 4-door sports car. The sales person asked if I wanted to take the 330i out and I said no. Reason being is, if I do, I know I will regret not getting one every day I drive something else. the other big positive, is the new stereo is ""ABOUT TIME"". The HK's in BMW's are flat out garbage and have no business being in such a car. The new logic 7 sounded awesome for the little time I used it.

HOWEVER,

The feeling from the drivers seat is tight. Both in a good way, and a bad way. It is a fully connected driving experience but it still feels small. A cruising machine this is not. Now the real bad. There is no noticeable difference in back seat room. I am 6' tall and I would want no part of sitting behind me. Also a very big flaw, it getting in the passenger seat. I must have looked funny as I got in and out several times, and each time I hit my left knee on the dash which is now bowed out rather than in. I can hear my wife now saying how much she ""hates getting in and out of that THING!"". I like the look, but I just feel from the outside the TL looks more aggressive. Something about the lower rockers that make it look more aggressive. I like the front and the back does not bother me but I bet that when the M3 hits we all say, wow thats they way they all should look. Much like the 5 series and M5.

that brings me to the TL and away from the G35. Since I feel (and you will too if you ever drive the new bimmers) that there is NOTHING like them, it does not make a difference what else you get, it is not the best. So other factors then come into play. The total size and interior of the TL I find gorgeous, not to mention they have every toy in the book. The germans make engines and the Japanese make technology. The Nav system and stereos on the TL are as you know, simply the best around. The seats are big and comfortable. And the back seat is perfect for a father of one who is getting bigger every day. I live in the northeast and front wheel drive also has advantages. Simply put the TL is a fast, and very nice touring sedan that is perfect for a commute.

I still need to give things a little thought. I really would love the BMW but I think the TL is a better fit for my life in 2005. I am going to be very jealous though every time I see a 330i screeming around some turn and the driver smiling from ear to ear.

I hope you liked my take.....

Anyway, I love my '04 6MT TL w/Nav, and don't understand other posters' comments re turns. The TL handles great - nice and tight, yet very comfortable. The only negative is torque steer. In fact, while I'm sure BMW are faster, my TL gives me more power than I can use. Great acceleration, great handling, great features, etc. Only problem is the torque steer."

I added the sport suspension with 18inch rims and the handling is right in the 3 series' league. The RWD drive is the number one attribute to a real performance car and that eliminated the TL. In addition, the TL & 3 series doesn't have the ""umfff"" factor that the G has. The power and acceleration is head snapping. Infiniti put there dollars into the performance..."
3302,byronwalter,"May 27, 2005 12:13AM","...it is a very good value and I felt that it would make an excellent high-speed cruiser. But the car just didn't feel good or dialed in when going through curves... at least as compared to the 330i I drove or even my under-powered Audi A4 with the itty-bitty 1.8 turbo (Quattro). I admit that this is solely my subjective impression as the test data that I have read in car mags indicate that the TL does generate good handling numbers. But the communication just doesn't seem to be there. The TL I drove really didn't like fast, tight turns. Might just have been that the tires weren't at a proper pressure. But can't argue with the TL pricing... the car is a nice deal, especially compared to the 330i.

Torque steer aint gonna bother my none on the merrit pkwy in CT and it just those times when you really feel like having fun that you will see the difference.

That's been my experience.

Regarding the looks of the BMW, I decided awhile ago the exterior looks of a vehicle is tertiary (even less important than secondary!!!!). Yes, it can provide an ""Ooohh"" factor with the valet, but if the interior is nice and the drive is good, that's all I care about."
3305,aaargh,"May 27, 2005 7:10PM","When it comes right down to it, the choice between the TL, BMW, and G35 is about what is important to you.

If performance is what is most important to you, the BMW or G35 is the way to go. They both excel (excuse the pun) in the performance department. But, IMHO, they are a little shy in the size, comfort, and luxury area.

If you are looking for a mix of good (albeit not top notch) performance with luxury, the TL is hard to beat, especially at several thousand less than the comparably equipped BMW and G35.

It's silly to argue one choice over another based on a magazine review. The magazine reviewers have different sets of criteria. CR is biased towards overall functionality. They view the car as a transportation appliance. The enthusiast magazines are looking primarily at overall performance. Since most of us don't have California's exciting canyon roads to traverse, that last little bit of handling prowess that the BMW may provide over the FWD TL isn't a meaningful differentiator.

I find the R&T and C&D reviews a little more helpful since they come up with a numeric score. That allows the reader to weigh his/her criteria differently and possibly arrive at a different conclusion.

As has been pointed out many times, these (G, TL, 3) are all very good cars and most of us would be happy with any one of them. Ultimately, it's probably going to be something subjective (e.g., interior quality, exterior appearance) that sways us to one over another."

I bought the TL because my kids were getting too big for the A4's back seat. I also drove the G35.

The G35 interior was just too cheesy for me. The steering and power were great, but I found the G35 skittish on high speed corners where bumps existed.

The TL is second to none in features and has a very nice interior. It's power is great. I must say now that after 8000 miles on it, I still don't think its handling compares to my A4. It is pretty good compared to most cars, but I was spoiled by the A4. The TL is a little 'floaty' going around curves when bumps are present. I drive to work up a canyon road for a 2 mile stretch and it is a great spot where the handling differences come out.

I still really enjoy the TL and will keep it for many years, but when the kids are gone to college I'm going to get a bit better handling car.

Needless to say, cars like ES300 or SUVs, minivans are OUT for me from a handling perspective. I guess I'm now picky enough that I need near the cream of the crop!"

3330,lmacmil,"May 28, 2005 8:34PM","""C&D advertises which compromises their credibility.""

I don't think that's necessarily the case. All the major car manufacturers advertise. When the car mags do a comparison test, something has to finish last, regardless of advertising dollars spent. I think if you looked back over the years, you'd find that the finish order changes and usually it's the newest model that finishes first, e.g., the new Infiniti M series is winning most of the comparisons lately.

Now if one manufacturer consistently won every comparison across all model lines, then I might believe the editorial opinions were influenced by advertising dollars.

Another thing that favors CR objectivity is that they buy the cars they test. I'm sure the manufacturer supplied cars that the car mags test are gone over with a fine tooth comb before being given to the magazines to evaluate. As long as they all do it, I guess the playing field is level."

""lots of posts"" ??? What is alot? A little balance/perspective - I own a '03 TL/auto. I have never had a problem of any type with any part of the car (although Acura checked out my tranny at my last oil change per a TSB).

The last time I checked, approx. 1.6 % of the TL population had transmission problems - and Acura did not shy away from their responsibility to repair/replace.

The TL is a great car (still amazed at the thoughfulness that Acura put into the little design details/ergonomics*, engine is flawless, etc.). All car manufacturers will occasionally have technical glitches (I believe the tranny thing was due to a supplier issue) but as long as they step up to the plate and meet their responsibilities - they will have my support and future loyality (i.e. cash).

P.S. *a small compliant I can muster is that the sunglass holder (between the visors) seems to be missing in the 04/05 models - if I am remembering correctly from test drive about a year ago.

3338,kasperghost,"May 29, 2005 3:15PM","Driving Impressions:

All MT

TSX:
Drive: Light, flickable, rev happy- happiness is high RPM's, tight tranny/clutch
Interior: Nice, well appointed- typical Acura
Exterior: Conservative- Classic, average rims

TL:
Drive: Nice drive, quite engine, lots of power, tranny smooth, I am sure the torque steer is there, but I live in a world of 8/10ths

Interior: Options galore, I felt a little on the claustrophobic side, it's 5 cf bigger than 330...?!?!, Liked the blue Instrument cluster , but it added this weird fuzzy look to the instruments, Windows seemed narrow, high sills, no 40/60 fold down, Limited interior/exterior color choices.

Exterior: Profile is great, Front/rear seem a bit slab sided, while this doesn't distract, I wonder if at year 5, I'll like it just as much, average rims.

G35:
Drive: Power- can you say, ""Slap me, Slap me again and call me Sally!""? Trans notchy, engine rough- not horrible mind you, but for an every day driver that I have to crank out a nice size check every month..., I like my engine noise, but not this much, gearing seemed short w/ a 6 speed and a 300 hp engine, Seemed to track very nice- had a point and shoot feel to it. Ride rougher than the 330 w/ sport pkg.

Interior: Much improved over last year- actually put real aluminum in there- what a concept. Seat controls- different...- wife loved them, nice shifter, open, good visibility, Instruments- blah- ugliest of the bunch, lots of options reasonably priced, cool back seat that reclines, no 40/60 fold down, Limited interior/exterior color choices. Can't put my finger on it, but interior seems 'off.' Wood package lame.

Exterior: Sexy beast, Cool 18 inch rims standard, back end good, but not great.

330:
Drive: Get out a fork and eat off of the flat torque curve- makes the engine have a more predictable feel, nice tranny- liked the stick shift- reminds me of the sticks they used to put in the Mustangs (1989), engine noise noticeable upon accel, but not at steady speed, new brake hold feature pretty slick (car holds brake on a hill until gas applied). Handling, well... it is a BMW. Steering wheel fatter, liked it when gripping in turns. Don't really know about rear wheel drive- I'm sure I'll like it- live in Denver too.

Interior: Clean, gauges easy to read, if you move the seat up a little, you can see a bit of the hood- I hate not seeing the hood, I feel like the front end doesn't exist, Sports seats are awesome, maybe I am just a Honda boy- but they need a clock up high for easy peaks, good visibility, vinyl as standard- cheap, start button worthless w/out comfort access. General comment: xenon lights and brake system outshine the other vehicles. ipod compatible-nice, line in for audio, a/c in console to keep favorite beverage cool for later, interior felt open but intimate, fit and finish- a cut above- I am a big fan of wood- warms the interior up, liked beverage holder placement- don't have to do the funky chicken to pull my drink from down low. Wide interior/exterior color choices. Why won't Acura do a blue/tan combo?

Exterior- classic, nice flowing lines, back end finally flows, muscular- but not over done, standard 16 inch wheels- lame- their option line up doesn't allow for 17's though. What happend to the sweet 17 inch rims they offered with the sport pkg from the e-46?

Oh please! Do you really think these magazines would compromise their journalistic integrity by letting the road test editors get free cars? I think these stories get started when someone doesn't agree with their reviews and/or comparison test choices.

Let's face it, aside from the objective measurements, every review is an opinion. These guys have their own set of biases based on their experience just like we all do. The only difference is that they drive cars for a living so their opinions are formed with more driving experience than most of us have. They have days (or weeks) and many hundreds miles on which to base their opinions rather than the hour or less and probably less than 50 miles for our test drives."

I haven't posted on this forum before, so I'm just sort of starting a new conversation. I think that you'd be happier in an A4, if you have one right now, than a new 3. I've seen two in person, driving, and they're not very impressive to look at. The 3 doesn't have as much presence as the old one, while the A4, from the back, looks like a little A8. After my '00 A6 2.7t's lease was up in April, I was taking delivery on a new convertible. I was pretty much completely sure of the S4 Cabriolet [which I have now, and am obsessed with], but I also checked out the M3 Convertible. It wasn't nearly as refined as the S4, and I am completely in love with my Sprint Blue S4 Cabriolet. I get so many admiring looks from people, the neighbors love it, and especially my family.

Funny, I've heard a lot of complaints that the ride was too harsh - I guess to each their own. FYI - don't know which model you drove, but the manual has a tighter suspension than the automatic, unless the automatic is an A-spec version. A 6MT w/ the sport tires rides even tighter.

I don't think the TL is intended to be a true sports sedan, like BMW or Infiniti G35. I think it intends to be a very sporty car that's 1 notch above entry-level luxury, and I think it does that very well."

As of now I've driven the STi, TL, an '05 & '06 330i and the new A4 two liter with a stick. The A4 seems like a pretty good deal compared to the 330i (I guess that the two liter really should be compared to the 325). There was about a month between the A4 and Bimmer drive so I can't pretend to give any sort of objective comparison... other than to say that they are both great. Frankly I can live with the exterior of the 330 but it's the interior that seems wanting, especially compared to the Audi and the TL. For 40 big ones I expect not only excellent road manners but an interior commensurate with the price. Later this year I'll go back and give the A4 another spin and mostly likely buy one.

But my fav was actually the STi. That little car ducks and weaves like Ali and growls like a Tasmanian Devil in heat. Anyone that considers themselves a car enthusiast should consider taking one for a spin. But the Subie is a bit thirsty and frankly I feel that things are going to get nasty in the energy sector. I currently manage a little better than 26 mpg with my '02 A4 and guess that the new A4 2.0t can even do a little better which is pretty good for AWD.

I don't have the experience to respond to most of your questions, but can tell you that if you need snow tires, you need them for all 4 tires. In fact, a website that sells tires (might be Tire Rack - not sure) will only sell snow tires as a set of 4."
3358,tstreet,"May 31, 2005 3:36PM","Not sure if it was a fair fight, seeing as the M35 is about 8-10k more, but I gave each of these cars an extensive road test. I have 2 friends with TLs and I have really fallen for them. However, after I tried Infiniti's M35, I never went back to the TL. At first glance the M35 is priced near 50k as seen on most dealer lots, but I soon realized that was with their ""sport"" edition. Turns out their base model rides much smoother, similar to the TL, and is only 40k. I opted for a couple packages and left the dealer at 44.6k Ultimately, the performance is pretty similar. They're both in that 270-280 HP range. I ended up making my decision on interior features and ""uniqueness"". One key factor was road noise - this was a hands down winner for the M35. As a frequent L.A. freeway driver, and as someone that often has passengers, this was important. Other things I preferred on the M35 - Standard 18"" wheels (19"" on the sport), more back seat leg room, and way more exterior color options. That said, the TL is probably still the best buy on the market, but I love my M35."

I'm in the Boston area with an '05 non-nav TL, Bridgestone Turanza EL42 tires. They are the worst tires in the snow that I've experienced in almost 30 years of driving (at least that I remember!). I got through this past snowy winter with the aid of all the traction electronics, common snow-driving sense and luck! We took the wife's RX300 on our few ski trips, but if I was going to regularly take my TL to ME, NH, VT etc. I would definately buy four snows or at the very least upgrade to a much better snow performing all-season.

In addition, I believe these tires flat spot (maybe that 's a characteristic of low profile tires?) which is a bit annoying. Other than that, they seem ok. If you get a NAV model, or 6MT I think you'll get different tires which others would have to comment on, snow-wise.

Other than the tires, I'm really enjoying the TL. Applied three coats of Zaino on Sunday, the Abyss Blue looks great!"
3361,laurasdada,"May 31, 2005 6:39PM","TST, good post. It's funny, I bought my TL over the G35X because I found the TL to be much smoother, quieter ride and nicer interior style/materials. Not to mention the superior exterior style of the TL.

Probably a more apples to apples comparison would have been the RL to the M35. But luckily, we both made the right choice in our purchases! Congrats, enjoy the M. It really is a nice piece of work. Infiniti's on a roll!"

I feel that the G35 has a roomier interior. I also liked the all wheel drive functionality for the winter but that it is all but off when you don't need it making the car feel like a rear driver. I grew up driving rear drive vehicles and I just prefer them. THe wife drives a Saab 9-3 Aero convertible and it's a great machine but the torque steer, while minimized, is still annoying. It's really splitting hairs here. These are both fabulous cars. It amazes me that the manufacturers have improved so much over the years. What a great time to be buying cars. I hope everyone enjoys their purchase, whatever it may be."
3364,aaargh,"May 31, 2005 8:23PM","I feel that the G35 has a roomier interior.

That's odd, because I came to the exact opposite conclusion. I think the G35 is taller and narrower and has a bit more rear-seat leg room than the TL. But the rear-seat head-room on the TL I found much better. I know you can recline the G's back seat, but I found it to be uncomfortable when reclined.

As far as space is concerned, the TL felt wider (roomier), more like a Grand Prix compared to the G35 which I felt was similar to a Grand Am. (The 2 Pontiacs were my last 2 cars before the TL).

I wish the TL had better storage compartments though."
3365,ljwalters1,"May 31, 2005 9:45PM","I agree with you regarding the TL feeling roomier than the G. I bet the measurements are similar, but some aspect just makes the G feel more closed-in to me. Maybe it's as simple as the fact that the G35 I drove had a black interior - that could've made it seem smaller.

Regardless I'm happy with the TL, and not sure what other storage space you would want, aaargh. We've got side door sill pockets that expand; a bi-level center console that's so deep they added a light to it; rear seatbacks; a little flip-out drawer in the back of the center console; closable/concealable cupholders; 2 drawers in the center-stack (maybe more if you don't have nav); and a decent-sized glove box. Only thing I can figure is you want a sunglass-holder in the roof or a drawer under the dash on the left side. Overall, I think there's a lot of storage space."

G35: The muscle car of the bunch. Powerful, thirsty, noisier engine. The car the folks running the event told me after my lap to ""keep it down."" It will power slide in a heartbeat! Would be the fastest with a good driver who could maximize its engine potential. Enough interior room to scare 4 other people along with the driver.

TL: The luxury bargain of this class. Plowed in hard turns, but a comfortable ride and a roomy, luxurious, and quiet interior. The one for a highway road trip with 4 passengers. Fast enough to merge on ANY expressway, but not adept on a tight-turning course.

330i: I haven't driven the E90, yet, but the E46 platform was the balanced sport sedan. Faster for me on the track because of the smooth power, even braking, and outstanding handling. Made me look smooth going flat out. Best for a 2 person car with occasional rear seat passengers."

So at this point I am more concerned about two things with the new IS. Can they restrain the electronic nanny enough to make it fun? But most of all, even if they get everything right, what will they decide to charge? I fear Lexus has realized they have some brand cachet to bank on.

I agree with the posting #3496 (jamesspot) and with the concerns of posting #3934 (sid3). IMO the G35 handles very well, and comparing the price and reliability issues to a 330i, I was seriously considering one. However, when testing it out, I found the noise level unacceptable (for me) and would never buy it on that issue alone - I'm not a twenty year old. The TL is just as jamesspot reviewed - he described my brother's driving style perfectly. My brother is a retired banker and he loves the car. I recently purchased a CPO 330Cic for my wife - she loves the convertible. I'm looking forward to testing out the IS250/350. I liked the IS300 performance/handling a lot but it was a little small and boy racer for me. If the new one handles close to the BMW and with a competitive price, I'd sell my 540iA for one.

3386,kdshapiro,"June 4, 2005 1:33PM","Why has BMW resisted going to a 3.5 liter engine? The numbers from BMWs new engines are impressive, but the competition is moving up to 3.5 liters.

Some thoughts:

1. They are trying to keep the power in the engines commesurate with the overall line up and the introduction of a 3.5L would throw everything off.

2. They want their gas guzzlers to be the big 8 cylinder engines. Comparing the 3.5L in the G35 to the old 3L in the E46, a friend who has a simliar commute as me gets 17 mpg, where I get 24. One can't have it both ways. A bigger engine that is thrifty on gas, but long on performance, unless they play with the gearing. One can probably expect real-world numbers to be in-line with the G35.

3. The heavier engine throws off the delicate balance of the car.

4. A 3.5 engine would not substantially make the car faster. People who post in the forums constantly say the G35 feels much faster than the 330i, but the stats as quoted in the magazines over the years don't really bear that out."
3387,kasperghost,"June 4, 2005 4:09PM","Kd- good points, and...

I think part of the engine size/power has to do with an auto makers philosophy. Ford, BMW and Honda all seem to subscribe to ""Selling well, don't change it."" For years, Ford's top selling Explorer sported a massive 160 hp and a stump pullin' 160(?) lbs. of torque, 4 ltr. engine. It sold well, why change it? In general, the big three tend to follow this model with Ford being the most conservative. Honda is another example. I think that BMW follows this as well.

Also, why do we need more and more? These automakers have all done well with the ""We don't need more (fill in the blank) to compete"" philosophy. They take what they have and refine and polish. When we bought our Pathfinder, we looked at the Explorer and liked a lot of the features; many of them very simple like the ability to fold the rear seats without taking the headrests off. Our Accord is a much more thought out car than our Pathfinder. I'll be sad to see it go."

I think the G35 is geared lower than most of the competition, which is how it gets its slight acceleration advantage but fuel economy suffers. If you look at the road test stats, the G is turned at lot higher rpm than most of the competition at highway speeds."

Obviously you're a bmw hater and you've not really driven one. HP means nothing if the cars don't really compare when driven.

you may not think so, but you've not driven them apparently. Even people who opt for a G35 will admit the cars have distinctly different personalities.

I don't think so. horsepower is part of performance, and BMW's have been way weak for a long time, that's a fact. if anyone's looked at hp numbers, BMW 3's have been under 200hp for years. (3 years ago, 330 finally made it above 200hp) $30,000 for < 200hp...?? CTS 3.6L 255hp.

The 2001 330i is over 200 hp - 225 to be exact. at that time there wasn't any real competition for the 3 series (IS300 had already floundered). In 2003 the G35 arrived and finally put some heat on the 3 series. The TL's sold well and will continue to without hurting BMW as it's not aimed at the same kinda driver. MB's never been big on power and Audi wasn't all that either. Only over the last 3 years has HP become a big issue (many would point to the G35 as the impetus for this).

Actually drive the cars, then comment on if it makes a difference that Caddy's CTS makes 255 hp or Infiniti's G pulls 298. Once ya drive them you'll see it's not all about the engine numbers. Audi's 3300 lb A3 with automatic (DSG) and a 2 liter 200 hp engine runs 6.2-6.3 0-60 dashes...in 2003 the 260 hp automatic G35 with the 3.5 VQ ran 6.2-6.3 0-60 dashes.

Heck, if BMW sold the 320i (150 HP) in the US I'd be driving one of those right now.

Claiming that 184 HP is ""underpowered"" is just plain silly. My E46 325i definitely isn't ""underpowered"" and neither is my 318ti (a whopping 138 HP). In fact, I'm not aware of any car sold in NA that can't reach any posted speed limit, and I'm sure they can all do it in a reasonable amount of time. My 1.8 litre made it from Atlanta to Daytona (~450 mi.) on one tank of gas (~13 gal.) while averaging 90 MPH for most of the distance.

cool, enjoying a car's feel is largely opinion and owners tend to happily rate their own cars high.
But I think in this performance forum, we are comparing cars side by side, and
seeing their performance vs value.
Is a G35 worth it, or BMW worth it. (or CTS, MB, etc)
So why is a 184 hp BMW valued at $30K compared to a 298HP G35?
Why would someone pay $30k for 184hp, when they can get 298hp for equal price.

Now test drives:
I think you can't get a feel by just test driving, I think only after owning and driving as a owner, can you really get the feel.

Now how about this:
After ownership, anyone in here think about maintenance cost?

I know there is another forum, but I think a relfex for BMW fans in here would be
""my BMW is great, no maintenance problems at all""

maintenance cost
BMW > G35 (check, maintenance forum)

it might cost more $'s after for maintenance."

5th gear? The e90 (all manual models) has 6 gears. And you keep posting the freaking e46 numbers...the car is no longer made. The e90 330i is a 21/29 and 20/30 car as I've shown you with my post from BMWUSA; in other words, the source.

And who says it's not a factor? Lexus made a point of mentioning great fuel economy with their new IS250/350. BMW mentioned the increase in economy on the e90 too. It does make a difference. I know I can beat the hell out of my e46 all day and still get 22/23 mpg while shifting at 5500-6k. I also know from experience with a G35 i'll get in the high teens doing that. And no matter how I drive a G35 on the open road...it simply will not get 30 mpg. 30 mpg as most have pointed out here is a snap with a 330i on the open road at hyper legal speeds.

After ownership, anyone in here think about maintenance cost?
BMW vs G35?

Yes most of us did and that's why many of us opted for included service cars like Audi and BMW. I've bought tires over the past 2 years. Two sets so far...so about 2k on tires. Doesn't matter if I got a G35 or 330i, i'd still be plunking down for new tires every 13-15k miles of driving.

The people I know with G35s have had to pay for oil changes, services (some as little as $100 and others over $500 for 15k mile check and 30k mile check up). Getting an oil change every 7.5k with synthetic will run you at least $50. So even going low, a G35 by 30k miles will cost at minimum (not including tires) $400. My BMW = 0.

but what about outside warranty? Average buyers in this bracket don't own more than 3-4 years. I leased my 330i expressly so I'd never own it out of warranty. In other words by 45k miles I will have bought tires for my car. Has it had problems in the first 30k miles? Yep. They haven't cost me one cent. So I really don't care if the car breaks down. It goes to the shop and gets fixed. No big deal. Five minute drive to the dealer and I can always use my other car or get a loaner. :P"

Yo-period-dude! BMW no longer uses the 184 hp mill in the 325i. Like it or don't, it's a fact. Get over it.

As for comparing cars on paper, you are showing your naiveté by your constant reference to the numbers. Please, go drive the damn things, then maybe, just maybe, you'll discover what the rest of us have already discovered; numbers don't necessarily equate to value.

Regarding the puny little engine in the former E46 325i, take a look at the One Lap of America results for 2005. The single well driven G35 beat the single well driven 325i by a measly 170 points (5195 vs. 5025), or, said another way by a margin of 3%. Hmmm, it would seem to me that if the G35 was SOOO much better than the E46 325i the margin of victory would have been far more significant.

True- but initial impressions are very powerful and research has shown them to be reasonably accurate.

Your speaking to experienced BMW drivers (me excluded). Drive one and do a comparo to the G35 in this thread. You are quoting the latest model G35, a 2005 w/298 hp. It is only fair that you drive the 2006 325i w/215. If you drive a 2005, it would only be fair to NOT compare it to a 2005 G35 but to a 2004 G35.

The handling is unbelievable and quick enough for me even with 184hp. I purchased the next generation 06 330i two weeks ago. I really liked the larger and wider body style and technological advances the car offered. I also test drove the Lexus GS300 and BMW 5 series but decided on the 06 3 series.

Overall I like the interior of the 06 330i better than my 1999 323i. Two aspects I am disappointed in are the harsh ride due to the run flats and the lack of initial acceleration. The acceleration is very slow after a stop. In fact my 323i has a smoother and quicker acceleration than the new 330i. The ride is much harsher and I don't get the same ""hug the road"" feel as I do with my 323i. I will seriously look at the redesigned MB C class when it comes out in 2007-2008 and possibly the next E Class or 5 Series.

""The point is, why are 325 more worth it vs a G35 (cts, c230, TL) ""

The only answer is that, from purely an economic standpoint, anything is only worth what a buyer is willing to pay for it. If I had wanted a 325, I would have bought it and it would have been worth it to me 184 HP and all. You're not buying horsepower, you're buying a car (to meet many personal criteria)! If all you value is HP, maybe Chrysler will sell you a Viper V10 engine for your living room...

What makes our economy the well oiled machine that it is is the lovely law of supply and demand (and, of course, competition. Laisse faire, Adam Smith and all that economic stuff...Simplifed explanation from a simple mind). Anybody can charge any price for anything they want. But, if there is no demand, guess what? That item is repriced (e.g. GM cars, ""Employee pricing for everyone!"") or withdrawn from the market (Are they still making the Aztek?). For a myriad of reasons, European cars have always been more exepensive than their domestic & Japaneese counterparts. (Although, with the advent of Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, European prices have come down. More supply/competition in the near/luxury market). However, as there is enough demand for BMW products, well, that's the price you pay, Doc. You want BMW prices to come down to G35 levels? You'd better start convincing the KDs and BlueGuys of the world not to keep buying Bimmers.

Obviously, a BMW is overpriced to you. You are correct. To KD & BlueGuy, a BMW is a good value. They are correct. I believe my TL to be a great car and value, I'm correct. I'm sure CTS owners feel their car is fabulous. They are incorrect...

Acura has the largest interior (think Honda Accord sized interior) then the Infiniti (think Civic sized interior) then the BMW (which feels cramped, think excel sized

The BMW 3 series has the best interior design, then its a toss-up between the infiniti and the acura.

The infiniti has the best acceleration, the BMW 3 series comes next with its high low end torque, the acura it right on its heels and the BMW 325 series really isn't in this category when it comes to performance.

The BMW feels like a higher HP/torque car than the numbers would indicate but it is still not as powerful as the infiniti and loses out to the acura at higher speeds. However, the low end torque really does make a big difference in how the car feels.

The BMW has the most responsive handling, followed closely by the infiniti and the acura trails having the most ""luxury feel"" of the three.

The Acura has the best NAV system, the other two suck.

The G-35s have intellikey technology which means that you never have to take the key out of your pocket, as long as the key is your pocket, you can open the doors and start the engine (makes it pretty tough to get carjacked).

All three of them sell for about invoice in the Washington DC area (the infinitis sell for slightly below invoice, the acuras for slightly above invoice and the BMWs are currently selling for around invoice (mainly because BMW has announced a minor midyear redesign, they are adding the intellikey technology of the G35 and improving their ""worst of class"" NAV system).

If the NAV system and the keyless technology isn't important to you, then you may be able to get a good deal on a BMW after they start shipping the new BMWs with intellikey technology and upgraded NAV system.

BTW get internet quotes BEFORE you ever step on a lot and see if anyone will beat them (I have had trouble getting anyone to beat the lowest internet quotes, actually I haven't been able to do it yet)."

I disagree *most* people can't tell the difference. I believe most people can tell the difference. But there are individual reasons for getting one car over another. We can debate these reasons.

The monthly sales figures for the TL and 3 series combined is maybe about 15,000. There are 15,000 individual reasons of why one was chosen over another. I can only tell you why I chose BMW. The other 14,999 reasons we'll either have to make up or guess."

The BMW handles better, but only at the limit. I also have a BMW Z3 3.0i and a Miata. The Miata autocrosses better than any of my other cars. I speed up for turns.
I would probably have purchased the Accura TL if it had rear wheel drive. I think it's the best looking of the three cars. Unfortunately, although I've owned some front wheel drive cars, I find them very unsatisfyining to drive near the limit. Too much understeer in the corners and torque steer during acceleration.
The Infiniti, blessed with rear wheel drive, is only a little behind the Accura TL in appearance and well ahead of the BMW 3 series. When the last BMW generation came out I couldn't order one fast enough. The new style leaves me cold. Additionally, to get comparable performance from a BMW, I'd need to get the 3.0 engine and spend a whole lot more than for the Infiniti.
When I test drive a car I usually scare the salesperson and I've tried all three cars. I like them all in different ways, but when it came down to my personal tastes the Infiniti was the best all around package for me.

The reduced sales might continue for a while yet as others wait for the other versions of the E90 to start arriving here (the 325, ix models, etc.).

3497,bmw3434,"June 15, 2005 10:21PM","New to the forum, but here's my opinion...
Recently, I had a chance to drive the BMW 330i, Acura TL and G35. It was in a large parking lot with acres of cones set up.
We had a chance to drive them as hard as we wanted back-to-back-to-back several times.
Now, I'll preface this by saying I know that you are not going to hop off the interstate only to find yourself in a 300 ft. slalom through cones leading into a 180-degree hairpin, but...
The TL's front end could not be controlled. I couldn't dive into a corner and accelerate out, otherwise a few cones would find themselves lodged underneath the front end. Sure, the interior was nice, and it was a rather large car.
The G35 was powerful, take-off speed was great, but when it came to turning the car back-and-forth, the body roll was horrible. It took a few laps just to be able to predict where the thing was going to straighten up and hopefully hit the right line.
That is what I loved about the BMW 330i. It was predictable, precise. I was always in control. The power was there, the handling was there (steering was tighter) ... It was a better all-around car in that situation.
Granted, when we took them on the interstate, all felt solid at 80mph+.
So, a lot will have to do with looks and price I'm sure, but one thing not being taken into account here is maintenance.
Sure, the Japanese cars (which, let's face it are Hondas and Nissans) will not cost as much to maintain, but BMW's is free anyway. I think you have to figure that in when you are doing price comparisons.
Any response is appreciated, and I've really enjoyed reading everyone's opinion during the last few days."

Just like everyone has an opinion with a car's exterior design, interior appointments, etc.... driving dyamics can be quite subjective as well.
Ive driven both a 325i and g35 and the difference in the handling is quite striking, but unlike you ive never driven them through ""acres of cones"" .

I guess what im trying to say is that as far as comparisons go, Motor Trend, C&D, Edmunds have endless resources when it comes to testing every aspect of a car but yet they come up with different conlusions, I was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the G35 over the previous generation 3 series...but in contrast to that Edmunds did a comparo a few years ago where a previous generation 03 TL S Type beat the 03 g35."
3500,bmw3434,"June 15, 2005 10:41PM","""I was somewhat steered by the fact that it seemed like most magazines favored the G35 over the previous generation 3 series""
I would agree. The E46 certainly lacked the power and overall room of the G35, plus, the G35 certainly would attract the eye more than say a 325i.
Yet, some folks like, and always will like, the ""low-key"" styling of the E46. I still love the styling of the early-90's coupe."

Your statement, however, is part of the reason."

3504,dhanley,"June 15, 2005 11:51PM","I have to second that--i have driven a 325i and a TL back to back through cones, and that alone put me off of the TL. I just couldn't use any power in corners. I thought even the FWD 9-3 was significantly better in this respect.

Now, most people don't care about this degree of at-the-limit handling, and if it handles an entrance ramp hard, it's fine. So for them the TL is probably better."

If it wasn't for a timing issue I'd probably be driving a G35 (coupe; 6MT) right now. I certainly don't think there's anything wrong with picking the G35. It's a superb automobile. If you're happy with it that's all that matters. The IS300 is also a worthy car. I wouldn't (seriously) criticize anyone for choosing any of these cars.

By the way, I didn't buy either BMW because they're BMWs. (That was somebody else.) I bought them because I thought they were the best cars that fit my needs at the time I bought them."

Why were you steered by other people's opinions?

Regardless, the G35 when pressed to the edge will snap. We're not talking a little oversteer...the car will sawp ends rather suddenly. I know because it happened to me. The editor here on Edmunds mentioned on his board that he had that happen to him too. Other mags bring it up and then move on as if it's no big deal. Maybe I push my cars harder than most but I don't like the idea of a car hopping or skipping sideways on my suddenly."

I'd add that the 6MT is a must. I also drove an automatic and there was a noticeable lag coming off the line that simply wasn't detectable with the manual.

As far as quality... The quality is fine, it's the reliability that's being questioned. As far as that goes, you might want to skip on the ""bells-and-whistles"", they just increase the number of things that can go wrong.

3513,fedlawman,"June 16, 2005 4:54AM","I remember my impressions of these three cars during the Lexus driving event I attended last year. They had an autocross of sorts set up, and I was able to aggressively drive the TL, 330i (E46), and G35 back to back.

As I recall, my impressions were that the TL was too soft (no surprise). The body roll was pronounced, and the car pushed through corners like the nose heavy, all-season tire wearing car that it was. It does have a fine interior though...

Next, the 330i (non-SP). The BMW had the best ride/handling compromise of the three, but it too felt soft when pushed hard through the corners. It didn't understeer as much as the TL, but it still pushed at the limit, and the body roll was significant enough for me to be turned off. With auto transmission, it was also the dog of the group.

Finally, I was most impressed with the G35. It was the Sports Car of the bunch. It had the most powerful acceleration and strongest feeling motor, and the suspension was firm (just right for me). It's remarkable that a car this large and heavy can feel so light and tossable. Body motions were well controlled, and the car was easy to steer with throttle. I do know, however, from a not-too-recent test drive that it's freeway ride is the harshest of the bunch. It's interior, though improved last year, still strikes me as cheap and contrived.

If I had to choose one as a daily driver, I'd have to take th middle road and say the BMW has the best compromise of the group. Soft enough to be comfortable on trips, but firm enough to have fun with. Certainly closer to ideal with the Sport Package and 3 pedals. If the E90 is an improvement, it's likely a fine driver (though too bloated for my tastes).

Just my $0.02."

Did the BMW have the performance package? When I drove the G35, I did not experience any excessive body roll. I drove the stick, which comes standard with the sport suspension.

I'm gradually coming to understand that I'll likely end up with a BMW, given that I want a reasonably well appointed car with a manual transmission & a fold-down rear seat.

Conflicted? You bet. Those who own one because ""it's a BMW"" drive me to distraction. Fortunately, many on Edmunds don't fall into that category.

Much as Mark (of Audi fame) was able to ""grow"" into an Asian vehicle, I've been learning that BMW's aren't always driven by the status-seeking people I've learned to avoid in the rest of my life.

Now, I'm watching the long-term reliability thing. For those of us who buy and hold, latching onto a 2-3 year old vehicle off-lease appears to be the way to go."
3529,shipo,"June 17, 2005 3:24AM","Your comments echo my own feelings of seven years ago. Back then I was a happy 1995 VR6 Passat GLX 5-Speed driver and was looking forward to getting a 1999 Passat with the same basic features as my 1995 plus a couple of extra goodies like power memory seats, climate control and automatic wipers. As fortune would have it, the 1998 Passat GLX was equipped exactly as I wanted my next car to be equipped, then came the 1999 model year. Bzzzt! I'm sorry, that is incorrect! Why? VW in their infinite wisdom discontinued the 5-Speed manual for that model year, and that model year only. Why? Beats the willies out of me.

As I refused to yield on my combination of a manual transmission and at the very least the power seats (I was valet parking two to three times a week at that time and YIKES can a parking valet screw up a perfectly positioned manual seat), and climate control (I hate fiddling with the controls every time the sun goes behind a cloud in the summer time). So, with the above in mind, that left the following cars:
- Infiniti I30/Nissan Maxima twins (ugly and mushy suspensions compared to my Passat)
- Audi A4 (too small in the back seat area -- two kids in car seats you know)
- Saab 9-3 (local dealer refused to order me one with a 5-Speed)
- Volvo S70 (same dealer as the Saab, and the same attitude regarding the 5-Speed)
- BMW 528i (too slow, couldn't afford the 540i, and ewwww, that BMW stigma)
- BMW 328i (a little smaller inside than the 1999 Passat but otherwise just about perfect excepting of course for that same BMW stigma)

With all of that said, once I drove the 328i, I was hooked. Nuthin' and I do mean NUTHIN' even came close, so, stigma be damned. I've been driving BMWs ever since.

2) The ""Slash & Burn"" drivers, which in days gone by were often exemplified by someone in a BMW slicing his or her way down a crowded roadway, cutting off folks with blatant disregard for anybody but themselves.

From my perspective, you cannot do anything about Stigma #1, it is what it is and now with the advent of the Japanese luxury brands, the BMW poseur thing has been reasonably diluted. As for the Stigma #2 folks, that too seems to have been a bit diluted in recent years with the advent of slammed Hondas, Neons and Gallants that many gear heads seem to be fond of.

At this point, now seven years after I initially went through the process of convincing myself to even consider driving a BMW, I don't even give it a second thought.

I live in a pretty rural, mostly farming area. There is not much money (at least not on display) in the area and an early 80's F150 is much more common than anything foreign.

On top of that, in my family - immediate, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc - I'm the only person with a college degree so again, not too much money floating around.

Those reasons are the exact ones I don't want to own a BMW. I don't want to be associated with yuppie achievers and wannabes anymore than the association one gets from owning a secretaries' car like an Eclipse or a the million pejoratives associated with Camaro/Mustang/Vette owners. The list goes on and on. At least Infiniti and Acura's TSX/TL/RL don't suffer from preconceived notions...they're simply solid, nice cars.

In the 80s and 90s Yuppies made BMW a symbol of greed, selfishness, conspicuous consumption (not at hummer levels but close) and new wealth. The car's abilities have become second to the logo. Buy one and you're immediately associated with that group of people. I recall a really close friend, a girl who worked for me and I view like a little sister, responded quite simply when I told her I bought a BMW, ""But you're not one of those people."" Yes, apparently I am. She's an attorney now at a huge law firm and she's making megabucks. When asked what she'll buy for her next car, she responds the same way, ""I'll keep my Hyundai until the wheels fall off.""

Ah but you're an individual and you're not part of that culture...right, but the reality is that people treat you differently based on things like the car you're driving (or the clothes you're wearing). I get 500% more people talking to me when I'm in the BMW. Especially girls. I don't like that! I stop for gas and people talk to me about the car. I don't like that! Other people in BMWs think we're in some kind of special fraternity and talk to me as if I know them. I don't like that. A few people I know - people I would not call friends - will ask me, ""Which car did you drive tonight?"" What difference does it make; they both seat 5!

If the car didn't drive the way it does, I wouldn't have bought one. Fought it tooth and nail and now I'm stuck in some guilt-ridden, angst-filled world where I despise what my car represents to 99% of the world but love the moment I turn the engine on."

I can simply say that you are getting physical enjoyment in driving you car, but you are not getting moral pleasure/enjoyment at all. I don’t thing you are getting 100% of what you could have.

Looked at the '06 3 Series the other day- still kind of tight, but really nice looking. A few friends own BMW's and they all love them. To each their own."

""In the 80s and 90s Yuppies made BMW a symbol of greed, selfishness, conspicuous consumption (not at hummer levels but close) and new wealth."" Or did Hollywood and Marketing enterprises do that?

Here in the Boston area, BMWs probably outnumber Hyundai's, very common. Growing up in one of the wealthiest places on earth (without me personally being wealthy) prior to moving to The Home of the World Champion Red Sox and Patriots ( ), I can't ever remember a comment or discussion ""stigmatizing"" anyone I knew with a BMW. The only converstaions I remember are how much fun they were to drive and how expensive and often they required maintenance. Or maybe I just care less what other people think. It's my money, my life, my choice. When someone else wants to buy me a car, then I'll let them have a say in it...

I drive an '05 TL. Could I have bought a 3, 5, C or an E? Yup (or even a Bentley. But then I'd still have to work long after I'd passed away...!). But I bought the car I wanted, given the parameters I set for myself. Have I ever heard someone say, ""Oh, a TL. Couldn't afford a BMW, huh?"" Nope. I suppose ""they"" could be thinking it, but then again I don't think I know any of ""they"" nor would I care if that is what ""they"" were thinking.

To each. If you deny yourself choice simply because of what ""they"" may or may not be thinking, have fun finding contentment. Although I often think ""non-car"" people are more content. ""Hey, it gets me there and didn't cost an arm and a leg! Now I'm off to my second home in The Hamptons after visiting both my kids at Harvard and picking up my new Patek...!""

Going along with your logic, why would the very people who are despised for buying BMWs mock the stigma of the car? That's like saying you lived among gang bangers and never heard anyone say slammed caddies on bling rims were for punks. That's to be expected.

Ya can't swing a dead cat in San Diego or Granite Bay, CA (my hometown) without hitting several BMWs. I'll stick with my theory that most BMW owners are exactly what I described. They're not buying for performance or fun-to-drive characteristics...they're buying for so-called prestige. As that one guy said, to him the BMW says to the world ""I made it."" The massive proliferation of steptronic 325s says it all. But to each his own.

About reliability. I still don’t understandwhy people say that BMW and MB are not very reliable. I ma not familiar with official statistics but I tell you that before I drove Mitsubishi Galant. And I also heard a lot of “non reliable” comments about this brand of cars. At that time (1997) it was the only car I could afford to buy new. And I must say it behaved perfect. With regular normal care for the car I did not have any real problems.

3571,laurasdada,"June 18, 2005 11:23PM","Hello, Odessit:

My prefrences are for a Luxury/Sport sedan (TL) as opposed to Sport/Luxury (325). Also, as a lifelong skier and denizen of the mountains of Vermont, New Hampster and Maine I prefer front wheel drive. I'll give up the 9 or 10/10ths handling advantages of RWD for the traction (and packaging) of FWD. The TL handles very well for my tastes. Having said that, the tires on the base TL are TERRIBLE in the snow! That'll teach me. I considered a 325x/330x but I decided I didn't need the added weight and complexity of AWD. I've gotten along just fine without AWD lo these many years in the snow/mountains. Not to mention my New England frugality just wouldn't let me spend so much more for the BMW, especially since I knew the '06 were on the way. Similarly equipped, the TL is less money. Had I really wanted the 3, I would have bought it and I'm sure loved it. But, for me, the TL was a bertter car and value. I also shopped the G35 and Mercedes E320 ( a different animal, I know, but it is such an appealing car to me. Again, I just didn't see the value proposition).

Of course now with 20/20 hindsight and a N.E. winter behind me, a rwd 3 with decent all-seasons would probably have better traction than my TL with the Bridgestones (they're supposedly all-seasons as long as none of the seasons include snow) in the snow! The best laid plans...

Anyway, had I gone with any of the other ELLPS I'm sure I would have been just as happy as I am with the TL. A wonderful class of cars, tough decision. You really can't go wrong.

Finally there's no hesitation to question a BMW's value. It almost seemed people are afraid to question BMW's, since it's been foolishly jamed into minds...BMW's are ""high performance, high quality..."". Mostly by magazines(press), friends(who like the label), and the high price to own.
But as these posts say, it's mostly opinion, and actually, BMW's probably aren't worth the high price for similar performance.
One thing I still don't see many people admitting, is BMW, Benzes, and Audi's low reliability and high cost of maintanance. I feel this is in the direction of pride. No one likes to admit cost paid, vs more cost spent to maintain.
And it is fact, BMW's do break down more then average,

and it does cost more once it's in shop (vs Asian, US brands). Of course it depends who drives, but when the car is in the shop, pull out the wallet."
3589,shipo,"June 21, 2005 5:10AM","One of the biggest problems that I have with folks who like to take issue with owning a BMW is that they like to dwell on the negative by slamming BMW because they are &#147;unreliable and expensive to maintain&#148;. That line of bilge has been repeated so often that to some at least, it has become fact. Sorry, but I have never seen any evidence, scientific, anecdotal or otherwise to support such a claim. The simple truth is that cars, ALL cars, are far more reliable now then they have been at anytime in history, and BMWs are some of the most reliable.

Ahhh, buy the naysayers will say, ""Oh yeah! Well just look at the statistics referenced in the above post. You'll see that Toyota has 196/PP100 vs. BMWs 262/PP100 rating.""

Uh-huh, well personally both numbers look pretty damn good to me, and furthermore, comparing the full North American BMW line (all fairly complex performance/luxury cars) to the full line of Toyotas (starting with no/low option strppo econo-boxes with far fewer components to fail) seems to be a bit disingenuous if you ask me. To my way of thinking at least, a much more fair comparison would be Lexus vs. BMW, and while I haven't seen those numbers in a while, if memory serves, the gap was much narrower. Even still, the report shows that for every four problems reported by a Toyota owner, a BMW owner will report roughly five. So much for being &#147;unreliable&#148;. I did find it interesting to note that BMW and a few other European manufacturers were singled out in the following quote: &#147;Porsche, Jaguar, Saab and BMW perform well above the industry average in dependability…&#148; as being quite reliable.

Another knock that I continually read about BMWs is that they cost a lot of money to maintain. That too is pure fabrication. The only out of pocket expense a late model BMW owner should experience for the first 50,000 miles is tires. Period, full stop, the end. Everything else is covered under the full maintenance program. Once a car has enough miles and/or years to no longer be covered under the maintenance program, they seem pretty reasonable to maintain, especially given their very long service intervals called for in the Owner's Manual. Basically, change the oil every year or 15,000 miles, change the brake fluid every two years and the coolant every three or four years (IIRC). As for the scheduled ""Services"", those occur every 30,000 miles, and while the cost can range from $600 to over $1,000, when you consider the number of miles that cost gets amortized over, it just ain't that much money.

Said another way, my bet is that if you were to do an ""Apples to Apples"" comparison of a new E90 3-Series vs. a new second generation Lexus IS, my bet is that the BMW will cost less money for general maintenance and repair than the Lexus for at least the first 100,000 miles. How much less? Probably not too much, but less is still less.

Me personally, I'm waiting to drive the IS and the E90 back to back, and I'll go with the one I like the best. Their relative reliability and the cost of maintenance is, in my mind at least, not a defining issue.

Shipo"

It is as if use of flowery language and the name is enough to make their cup run over. Reminds of an old chestnut: Guy buys a BMW and drives it OTD, car stops 2 miles later.

Uh-huh, so, where are the scientific numbers to back your claim up. Just because I might say, ""Car 'X' is the most reliable or the least expensive to drive and maintain"" doesn't make it so. The same thing with what you've written; saying it doesn't make it so.

Ah but because of the all inclusive 4 yr/50k warranty, maintaining a bmw comes down to new tires once a year. If you're gonna keep the car for more than 3-4 years then maintenance costs become an issue with any car.

Then again, if one buys a G/TL, you gotta get oil changes, tune-ups and so forth.

So for the millionth time - because you're beating a dead horse - total cost to maintain of my 330i - $2000 over two years. All spent on tires."

I bought a BMW 318ti in August of 1995 and drove it daily for 9-1/2 years putting 112,000 miles on the odometer. In that time I had one (1) mechanical failure -- the ignition switch went out and need to be replaced. I think it cost me something like $275.00, I forget.

I'm sorry, but it would be disingenuous for me to confess to reliability problems I haven't had. I'm not saying that BMW's are problem free (no car is), it's just that reliability ratings can be misleading. Just because it says that the average maintenance cost of a BMW is X amount of dollars, doesn't mean that everyone who buys one is going to wind up spending that amount. I'm sure there is someone out that bought one just like mine that has sworn off BMW forever after the gazillionth trip to the repair shop, but I'm not that guy. Quit accusing us lying just because we won't reinforce your preconceived notions of German car reliability.

I drove the E90 330i, G35, and A4 3.2 quattro on a closed course in Atlanta last Friday. I had driven a similar Lexus event a year ago. Told my professional race car driver instructor to tell me to keep it down if I was too aggressive. He never said boo - but I figured I was braking at the proper time when his foot hit the passenger floor board at the same time mine went for the brake.

Observations (all cars were automatics):

A4 - Heavy and understeering. Must be hammered with tires squealing, trusting in the AWD to drag you out of corners.

G35 - A ""beast"". Good power and unforgiving handling. Transmission drops back to idle when you come off the gas, leading to delays in getting the power back down.

New 330i - An amazingly balanced sport sedan. A smoother ride and more room than my '04. Active steering on an autocross course was telepathic. Brakes, engine, step transmission in sports mode, and suspension all in sync.

Did a hot lap with the pro at the wheel - shifted the BMW's steptronic transmission manually and left it in second and followed the line - woohoo!

Feed back on MY driving - needed to use the FULL width of the course side to side for the most speed through the cones. I also tended to either go full throttle or braking vice a graduated release of the throttle / application of the brakes as the steering input comes in and then the reverse as it comes out.

A great experience to drive all three cars all out at a slow speed (50ish) autocross limit on a 1 mile closed course.

BMW free maintenance notwithstanding, it is an inconvenience to bring the car in for multiple software glitches and such. In addition, I am not convinced that the service bays have a handle on these problems yet. You hear plenty of stories around here about BMW service departments not having a clue what gives with current electronics. A colleague of mine has a 7.

Additionally, I'd take the following over an e46 325i in the order I'd pick em: A3 2.0 DSG, TSX 6 mt, Legacy GT 2.5 5 mt, G35 6 mt, A4 2.0 6 mt."

In this instance you may be correct- I don't know enough about the racing situation to say otherwise. Couple of things that could be factors:
Acura et all, needs street creds that BMW already has and doesn't feel the need to through the money into this series- If you notice, many of the BMW's listed in the race series are no longer manufactured...

Please cite proof: salaries, win, loss, place on different platforms of the drivers would be a start.

What a way to build sales, ""...beat BMW in such and such situation.""

Name a NON-homogolation series where the builder had a choice of RWD vs. FWD platform and purpose built a FWD

Name a make and model of FWD car that is considered a sports car classic (there are many Japanese RWD classics, Datsun B2000 & Z cars to name a few) Cite championship results.

Name a major race that has been won by a FWD car (Non-homogolation)

Please cite the physics behind the reasons that a FWD car is better than a RWD car. Assume we have a reasonable understanding of mass, acceleration, yaw, etc.

In general, the three series does quite respectable in racing. Please show us a general trend in the giant world of racing that FWD kicks RWD or BMW is getting whipped by FWD machines.

But not necessarily more balanced. Subaru's eat FWD cars for lunch at rallys. Look at the Mini-Cooper, of course it is a niche vehicle with little use for a family of 4, but it drives great.

You can take an E90 and drop a V8 in it, like the rumored new M3 and then it's a different story. You will still have a balanced sport sedan that will get to 60. In what 5 or less seconds and do 179 or so without even breathing hard. How about dropping a V8 in a TSX and then running it on a racetrack? Think it will be balanced, or it will be able to even keep up with an M3? Now I'm just using that as an example.

So yes in certain situations FWD may be preferable, in certain limited types of races/rallyes/event it may even do very well against RWD vehicles with limited torque and hp."

There are 2 points:
1:
A car does not perform better because it is RWD.

2.
not many people believe fwd outperform rwd and
even less people can actually explain or experience the skills
and techniques required to drive fast and win a race vs RWD (or whatever).
FWD can outperform RWD regularly, which to many is a myth.

I believe the reason is,
there aren't many people who race FWD cars vs RWD ( in these forums)
and i think there are even less people who race professionally and win (in these forums) to be able to explain how and why.
It takes experience/skills in both rwd and fwd to be able to explain the difference, how and why."

No, he said that FWD and RWD don't matter for performance, which is incorrect, and he used a series in which FWD was competitive to ""prove"" it. That proves nothing, since the cars have been modified to be competitive irrespective of their natural advantages and disadvantages.

I may be wrong, but I'm guessing the cars were modified to have, basically, similar power/weight ratios, no? If you were able to tell me that they had to give the FWD more power and less weight than the RWD car, well then you'd have an argument. But if they weigh the same, have the same power output, same transmissions, same suspension, etc, etc, and the ONLY difference between the cars is how it puts the power to the ground, then that is the only thing left that could make a difference between them on the track.

Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it really is a 300 hp, 2800 lb. TSX vs. a 250 hp, 3200 lb. 325. In which case, no, its not a good or fair comparison to use at all."

you know, it seems post 3784 was argueing the definition of FWD.
the power is still being put the ground with front tires (FWD) or read tires (RWD)
or it was debating the class rules..
come on...even with evidence, facts, results, there seems to be excuses.
now what if this was reversed.
say I posted RWD better then FWD??
think I could justify...""but the rules were evened out towards RWD""???
The purpose of racing organizations is to balance the competition. That does not mean convert FWD to RWD, and RWD to garbage.

You must think you fully understand and are basically saying the SCCA is unfair,
because it is ""impossible"" for a FWD to drive faster then a RWD.
and if FWD did win, so what, the rules were unfair. haha
I'll sum it up. It is impossible for FWD to beat RWD.
And if it did (somehow) it is because rules are different and RWD were so unfairly comprimised.

See how these replies are sooo clouded, so blinded by rebutle.

The point is, you cannot explain how to drive a FWD fast, so the rules must have been unfair. Or the car basically wasn't a FWD car anymore. The rules transformed the FWD car into AWD, and made the RWD into a bicycle (1WD).

The tire wear that blueguy talks about is due in large part to the aggressive wheel alignment of the BMW sport setups. Tires last MUCH longer without the sport suspensions. For instance, a colleague of mine just replaced the tires on his non-sport 530 after a whopping 75k miles.

Performance tires will also wear quicker. The higher the speed rating, the quicker it will wear. Aggressive driving will also cut into tire life, bigtime.

Plenty of Porsche owners typically change tires between 8K-12k miles and it is due to all of the above. They don&#146;t even race their cars, not on a track anyway.

The TL's firm ride is well-controlled, with good isolation from bumps. The highway ride is steady, and the cabin is very quiet. The wide turning circle is one of the few negatives. The Acura feels taut and responsive in cornering, with well-contained body lean. The nicely weighted steering is communicative and quick. In emergency-handling tests, the TL demonstrated good tire grip and cornering balance, and it proved secure in our avoidance maneuver, where it posted a quick 52.5-mph. Powered by a smooth 270-hp, 3.2-liter V6, the TL is noticeably quicker than many of its competitors. Even with such high horsepower, the car was largely devoid of torque steer, a tendency for the front wheels to briefly pull the vehicle off its intended line under strong acceleration (common in front-wheel-drive cars). The engine is coupled with a smooth and responsive five-speed automatic transmission. The TL gets a respectable 23 mpg overall and meets Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle standards, which means that it is 50 percent cleaner than the average 2004 model. Braking was very good. :P"

You chose the TL and you are very happy with your choice even though, as you say, you could have purchased something more expensive.

If you mean gear ratios, I think the G35 gearing is pretty short. Driving on the freeway at 80 mph (my usual highway cruise speed) in sixth gear you get 2.5 - 3 k rpms. I can even drive at 40 mph in sixth gear on a relatively flat road without having the engine complain.

I kind of wished 6th gear was taller so I could get better gas mileage cruising on the freeway. Oh well. Of course this shorter gearing is better for performance because you can use more gears when accelerating. Also a shorter sixth gear means you dont have to shift down if you want to pass some one on the freeeway. So I think this is a better choice after all.

But the G is definately not one of those german cars with a super tall sixth gear made for cruising at 100 mph."

Give me a really, really tall 6th. If at 80 I still need more power to pass, I'll fall back to 4th and take off. I still get over 30 mpg running 85-90 all day in my BMW but I still wish the car's 6th gear was even taller.

Greetings! I'm a former owner of a '00 ES300 and '02 ES300. I *absolutely* loved the prestige of driving a Lexus. The color combo of the '00 was graphite/black and the '02 was gold/cream. I definitely prefer the black interior and I have quite honestly been spoiled with the luxury convenience features like heated seats, passenger control climate, moonroof, speed controlled volume, etc. The '02 had a Nav system, rain sensor wipers, and more bells and whistles than I could imagine but the radical change in body style reminded me too much of a Camry and I would prefer s distinct style in my vehicle. (I actually walked up to a Camry on several occasions thinking it was mine).

So now I'm looking at the '02 or '03 GS430 (I like the luxury sport sedan combo), the '04 G35 and the '04 or '05 Acura TL. I'm hearing great things about the Nav system in the TL which is not a need but a definite desire. Some of the things that I have not experienced but would like to have are:
-Bluetooth capability (I didn't have a Bluetooth capable phone when I had the '02)
-Steering wheel controls for radio/cd
-DVD/CD Player
-Voice commands for Nav
-Traffic guidance for Nav
(I hear these last 2 items are features of the TL's nav system)

Oh and my price range is low 30's. Yes, I know I want the world. (But what's a single female with no children to do these days besides splurge on herself before she's unable to do so?) I'm not sure I want to give up driving a Lex but I just might have to. Any thoughts?"

If you are a high performance driver, there are better choices, but the TL is the one MY wife would want as you are both steeped in luxury and driving a good-looking machine.

3745,blueguydotcom,"July 19, 2005 4:09AM",An 04 TL is nearly two model years old. 06s are two months away...so 24-30k miles is normal.
3746,ljwalters1,"July 19, 2005 1:04PM","I'll have to weigh in on the side of the TL - here's some general comments (no particular order), and I include a little scoring system (+1 for 1st, 0 for 2nd, -1 for 3rd) that's really just for my own fun.:

1. RIDE QUALITY. As far as ride quality, I'd guess you prefer a cushier, luxurious ride to a sporty, tight ride. The used GS430 your considering would probably have the best ride, but with all the high-tech features you want, the TL would probably be a good compromise between comfort, price and features. The G35 has the most sporty, probably least forgiving ride of the 3. (GS 1; TL 0; G35 -1)

2. STATUS. I think Acura has the least status among Lexus, Infiniti and Acura. I think Lexus is #1 of those 3, so the GS has it here, too. (GS 2; TL -1; G35 -1)

3. FEATURES. The used GS isn't going to be the most technologically advanced. Of the 3 cars you might be considering, the TL has it hands down, with all the features you mentioned except for traffic navigation (only in the RL & maybe the Infiniti M) and a video player. You'll also have to say goodbye to rain-sensing wipers (something I sorely miss from my last car). The voice-recognition of the TL's nav and its integration with climate control and the radio is utterly amazing!!! I cannot understate this (you can be driving and just verbally tell the car to change the temp, pass temp only, direct air through particular vents, etc. You can scroll through your presets, and when there's nothing on the radio, direct the cd player to play any particular track on any particular disc - it's awesome!!!!). As an aside, the Infiniti M, which is out of your price range and might be too rough a ride, has the best technological features of any car I know. If it came with a manual transmission, it'd be my dream car. Another bonus to the TLs nav is that it's a touch-screen, which makes entering info manually much easier than otherwise, and you can enter info while in motion. My parents Lexus does not allow this. I don't know about the G35s nav, but, in general, I think the G35 is the least technically advanced of the 3, but a new G would have it over an onlder Lexus, I think. (GS 1; TL 0; G35 -1)

PRICE. I'm not checking the classifieds for you, but I know that to get all the tech features you want, it'll add much more to the GS, since it'll probably need to be aftermarket, if it can be done at all, and it'll cost the least extra on the TL b/c it's all included, except the nav, which is pretty common. Depending on the changes made on the '06 models, you might be willing to save even more $$$ by buying a used TL or G35. (GS 0; TL 1; G35 -1)

Anyway, my scoring has the TL ontop (no surprise - it's what I drive), but disregarding the scoring for a sec, you need to discount the BMW & G35 b/c they value sportiness over luxury, and you seem to prefer luxury. The GS has it in luxurious ride and prestige; the TL has it in technology. I think your choice comes down to those two, and will depend on which you value more.

PS - I think a guy will be more impressed by a TL than a GS. As a single gal, that might play into things a bit."
3747,perunest,"July 19, 2005 4:57PM","The past two season Bill Auberlin won the Touring car national championship in a BMW 325. This year he's down in cumulative points because he's only raced a few events, since he is also racing in other type events. He won the last Touring car race at Lime Rock Park a few weeks ago.
Comparing these highly tuned machines is not an indicator of which is faster. Each car has weight added (or taken out) based on how well they did in the previous race. If you win two races in a row, you get weight added each time. They intentionally try to level the field to make it competitive for the fans.
Front wheel drive or rear wheel drive is a personal preferance, but more people who like to drive spiritedly choose rear wheel drive (and a manual transmission). The current issue of Automobile Magazine compares what they call the best sports sedans from three continents. They selected the Cadillac CTV from the US, the BMW 330i from Europe, and the Infiniti G35 from Asia. They made a point about leaving out a very good Acura TL, because it was not rear wheel drive and therefore not a ""true sports sedan"". I've owned alot of cars over the years, including a number of front wheel drive models. Nothing could touch my two Miatas for handling (the Miata has 6 consecutive national championships in autocross). I currently drive a 2005 Infiniti G35 6 speed and a 2002 BMW Z3 3.0i 5 speed roadster. Rear wheel drive has a different feel to it. You either like it or you don't."

3754,delmar1,"July 21, 2005 7:30PM","Based upon your requirements...the 2005 TL is my recommendation (and which I own).

Why I would recommend? If you enjoy the luxury of a Lexus, then the TL has the mix for you. The interior is definitely superior to the G35...and will remind you of the Lexus GS series. It even rivals my 2004 BMW 7 series.

Features....it has all the items you have indicated. Bluetooth...controls, etc. If you order them through the G35...you are looking to add $7k above the TL through a package.

Stereo...6 CD indash changer...with 8 speakers with universally accepted superior performance. Controlled with buttons on the steering wheel.

Dual climate zones. Power seats. All the features you indicated are included in the model without any premium packages to buy.

Performance...well it has 270 hp and the latest Car and Driver magazine shows that it can easily keep up with the BMW 3 series. Past reviews from others show a very competitive performance to others in its class.

As for pricing...you can get a non-navigation TL for about $30.5k...nav for about $32k. G35...$37k+ with horrible 16MPG in mixed driving. Get a similarily equiped BMW 3 series...pay $48k. Lexus GS...pay $50k+.

If you really want something different...look at the TL in Dark Green exterior with the Parchment or Camel interior...which will have wood trims included at no cost. That is sharp and similar to the Lexus interior.

So yes...you can have the world! And you will never pine to drive your Lex again"

3757,blueguydotcom,"July 21, 2005 8:56PM","And with incentives right now on the 05s, a G35 is a good 2k lower than sticker WITHOUT negotiating."
3758,delmar1,"July 21, 2005 9:03PM","Allow me to support the $37k+ pricing for a G35...as I have been challenged by another to substantiate..

A base G35 6mt coupe is $33,350. Add in the premium package ($2450), Navigation ($2000), XM radio ($400 a must if you are going to compare to the TL), splash guards ($210), plus destination ($610). Total MSRP = $39,020.

Quotes I received a month ago were at $37k+. Perhaps I could have negotiated pricing further down...but I determined the TL was for me.

To substantiate my claims...go to the ""G35 prices paid and buying experiences"". Review recent posts #2625 and #2627. Pricing of $37,030 and $37,700 respectively.

Where you got $29k for a non-navigation G35 I do not know..as the base msrp is already $33k without any premium package. A stripped down version with nothing...no sunroof...nothing....when the original poster was one that required amenities and in order to compare to the TL.

The fact that the 2006's will be out in a couple of months doesn't really help us,because most dealers in the area including ourselves will be out of 2005's before they start coming in.

3763,delmar1,"July 22, 2005 2:58AM","Still think I am misleading? My apologies...but let me mention a few items to clearify that my intent was not to mislead.

First...most likely than not...when people think of G35..they think of the coupe and the sedan is a secondary thought. Therefore...I priced the coupe. I hope I supported my pricing of $37,000 for the G35 Coupe 6mt in my previous note. I think all will agree to the prices paid as demonstrated on the board postings on this web site. The $37k is fact.

As for the price of the G35 sedan...I did not specifically get a pricing. However I understand that it is roughly about $35.5k. I believe compared to the TL w/nav of $32.2k which was demonstrated by 'laydi' email quote from the dealer.

Second paragraph. Yes...I did not bargain further on the G35 as I disclosed in my initial note. However...once again...the pricing I provided is pricing paid by others on the board...after negotiations. Please refer to the messages on the board which I referred to...those are actual paid prices ($37k for a G35 6mt coupe). I did not make them up. $37k...fact once again.

So let me summarize. Most think of the G35 as a coupe. The G35 6mt coupe with Nav is selling for $37k according to multiple postings on this web site's board. The G35 sedan is approximately $35.5k. These prices compares to Acura TL which is being initially quoted to a prospective buyer at $32.5k...with a likely purchase price of ~$32k after negotiations.

All in all...forget the discussion of the pricing. Look towards my initial email today which goes over the various amentities of the TL...and how it addresses 'laydi' initial email which communicates her wants and desires in a car....she wants the world. The TL should be considered."

You're right...any person with decent negotiating skills should be buying lower than carsdirect.com's price.

I am not making it up...just look at the prices paid on the boards. Re-read my message #3902 and you will see.

Those people aren't very good at what they're doing. The G35 6mt with navi, xm, premium and splash guards (what blazes is that?) is listed for 33k on carsdirect.com. I'd expect any infinit dealer would beat that by $200-500.

There's a $2000 manufacturer to dealer incentive on the G35. That means, get the price to $200 over invoice (what one should pay for a car this old) and then subtract another $2k from the price. that's the target. of course 200-500 is more realistic.

And if you can't get a dealer to let you in on the $2k, that dealer isn't worth going to."

You're a knowledgable poster, and in my book, your past posts have earned you the benefit of the doubt.

Depends on what your looking for. The G35 sedan will mop the floors in performance against the TL. If you take these cars to the racetrack you will see the difference.

First, I've seen figures in the low 5s for the G35. Second as I said, the TL is great until you try to swing it around a racetrack. That difference is felt on the streets.

On one hand you can't talk performance, on the other hand you can't say what will happen on a racetrack doesn't count because they are street cars.

Otherwise it was a difficult decision and every time I see a TL (very often here in northern NJ) I question if I made the right choice. I love my car and time will tell, expecially next winter when I determine if the AWD was worth it. BTW, 8300 trouble-free miles and counting. I've heard alot about the difference in the sound systems in these cars. I have the Bose and, for my 52 year old ears, it sounds fantastic. The TL's was also great but I'm not sure it was better. Bluetooth was not needed yet since I don't own any Bluetooth devices and we have an aftermarket Garmin nav system so that was not a decision maker either.

The car was only $10k more than a V-6 Accord and less than $5k more than either the TL or the G35. To me - worth it. Still, the smaller engined 325i outsold the 330i by 6 to 1, so price does make a difference, even for the average BMW consumer.

I really like the TL - a very nice car - good-looking, fast, comfortable, a beautiful interior, and all the high tech done right.
I also like the G35, particularly with a manual transmission. It has ""V-8 like"" power and good brakes. The automatic transmission is the weakest link in the G35 sedan.

I think the GS300 and 430 are in another class all together and compete against the 5 series BMW and the Acura RL. The Lexus equivalent is the updated IS250 and 350. I'm still waiting to check those two out. The old IS handled fine, but was a bit gaudy for my taste.

3787,nyrefugee,"July 22, 2005 10:06PM","""The G ""Base"" sedan has no amentities and is not comparable. Need to upgrade with the premium package and sports suspension package.""

Ok I really do not like flame wars, but since some people may actually use these forums to make a car buying decision I feel like I should disagree with this statement.

The G base actually has a lot of features. Power leather heated seats six cd in dash changer with mp3, adjutsable wheel with telescoping, adjustable rear seats, power window and mirrors, side and curtain airbags, xenon lights etc. Not as much features as the accord of course but enough that you are not really missing anything. And as such it is 2k cheaper than the base acord. If you insist that the premium package is necessary for comparison then the g35 is about 1.5 k more expensive.

And no the G35 does not need the performance package to compare with a base accord. The G35 multilink suspension is more advanced than the acura double wishbone one. Also the G35 uses aluminum in its suspension elements I am not sure if the acura does (they dont mention it, which probably means they use steel). In any event the g35 will handle better even if you do not consider the acura's fwd. And the problems with the fwd have already been beaten to death in these forums. So in conclusion a standard suspension g35 will handle better than the standard TL suspension.

On top of everything else if you get the manual tranny you get the performance package standard as well. So then you have to add the 18 inch wheels to the tl in order to make it comparable. So the G35 with the premium package will be about the same price as a comparable tl with the 18 inch wheels. I cannot give exact numbers here because the 18 inch wheels on the TL require unspecified dealership installation charges.

So in summary:
g35 auto vs TL auto = TL is 1.5 k cheaper
g35 manual vs TL manual = about the same price

In these packages the TL has some more features and better interior while the G35 has more powerful engine and better handling. There you go."

That posting is sexist. I am a female and an educated professional in her early 30s who happen to drive a TL. I have driven grocery haulers (Camry) to a Mercedes SLK. And I select the TL for many reasons. Not because I am odd. Or I am masculine. And I do not scare men off with my car.

As for whether I drive like a 'lady' as another here suggest that the TL drivers are....shame on you. How narrow minded. You must drive alone a lot.

As a point of reference for the original poster 'laydi'...the TL was purchased because the TL is the best value out there. It is well balanced between sports and luxury. It has all the supple luxury you would expect from a Lexus as you have driven. It has leading edge technology such as bluetooth. It has the amenities that can impress. It is a pleasurable car to entertain with. The performance is fun and exciting (forget all the discussions here of 0-60 times and the thought that aluminum in the suspension makes for a superior car) (I doubt many that slam here haven't even test driven the TL).

Are the above attributes of why I purchased my car only valued by females? I doubt. Just as not all males measure their cars by 0-60 times but by other attributes.

As for a lot of these recent postings, these are my thoughts. The people in the G35 camp....they are sports purists and are slanted more towards the 'sports-luxury'. The TL contingency is slanted more towards the 'luxury-sports'. Who is right? Nobody.

If you do wish to beat up on each other...there is the ""Acura TL vs G35"" board. Sample include this...

Actually IMO the G35 sedan is the one which is not in the same league as the other 2 -- even if the other 2 play in 2 different leagues! The G is no BMW when it comes to performance and driving ""feel"", and it is no match for the TL when it comes to features, amenities and quality, and it is inferior to both in terms of styling!

Please don't put words in my mouth. Crown Vic is not a sport sedan or luxury sedan, so it is quite off-topic. A 530i is nowhere nearly as good at handling as a 330i, yet it is much more expensive.

Sure there is more quantity in Country Buffet, but there is more quality in the local 5 star restaurant.

For me the 330 has all the vehicle utility I need, plus it's the benchmark, and it gets great mileage to boot. If you haven't noticed there isn't one manufacturer in this topic that doesn't set price by size of their automobiles.

How about slalom? TL 65.8 mph vs G35 65.0 mph. If ""measured"" performance in slalom is not good indicator of car's handling ability, then what is? What else is there that can be measured that one can point to for sake of discussion?

Sometimes car magazines do comparisons of car's handling by testing lap times at a race course. But, this is not part of R and T Road Test Summary in magazine each month. Maybe somebody can find a comparison test on a race course from some magazine regarding the cars in question.

Also, Road and Track, measures BMW 330 at 65.4 mph in slalom. This is less than TL, but within margin of error, or ""significance of difference"" of 1.0 mph that Road and Track states. So, according to Road and Track Summary data, actual ""measured"" handling shows G35, 330 and TL having very similar capability."

Thats probably true, it was definately inspired by the alfa romeo sedans which are some of the most beautiful cars on the road. But I am not sure if it quite pulls it off. I think the acura's thin headlight look leaves way too much flat empty plastic in the front. The alfa, on the other hand has a more pronounced V-shaped grill which cuts through the bumpers. So you dont get flat slabs of plastic.

Agree. Think that Autoweek had first spy photo of possible 04 TL in summer of 03 in front of San Fran hotel. When I saw it in Autoweek (in silver), I thought it was stunning and wouldn't it be great if it was production model. Turns out that it was production.

If Alfa was inspiration, think that TL does better interpretation. Don't care for overdone V shape of Alpha.

G35 coupe is great design. G35 sedan very good, but not knockout like TL.

Don't necessarily agree that looks are very subjective. Think that when design is so very good (Porsche 911) or very bad (Pontiac Aztek) that most people can discern these differences. It gets harder when the designs are between these extremes.

There are elements to good design. Columnist for Automobile Magazine, Cumberford, is a former auto designer and he critiques car designs in almost every issue. Check it out.

I think that the new 3 style looks more feminine. I refer to my 06 325 as “she” , like “my girl” The previous body style is sharper, more masculine. In my eyes old body style of 3 is like arrow – you look at it and it really looks fast, fast like and arrow. I guess I am just in love with bimmers:) But everything changes; bmw simply could not afford to stay behind and not to change body style while other manufactures do so. And in my opinion new style is very good, its still bmw; it’ll just take time to get used to it.
TL is a VERY nice and sharp looking car. It is really a matter of preference who likes what – TL or 3. Both are awesome styles. Before I thought of buying TL, but then I said to myself – no, I’ll spent a bit more $ but get what I always wanted. But still –TL is a very sharp and fast looking car. Really distinctive design, not like other cars.
G35 – sorry, in my opinion it does not look good. At least no comparison to TL or 3 styles. Drove G35 just a few days ago. Power is the only thing worth mentioning. Design –inside and exterior – far from perfect to my taste. No offence to all owners of G. Perfect engine, MUCH faster than my 325.

Hmm. It's a little more bland. The sides are too slab and unbroken. The old car's thick breaking lines and bisecting angles help give the car more edge. Original e46's had the best look; the facelifted e46 lost some of the car's angle and chisel. Can't say I'm real in love with the look of my 330i. Never owned a car I found real attractive though.

Have TL and G35 designs/styles left 3 series in dust?

Well, the poor G35 also suffers from slab-side-itus. The has absolutely nothing going on really anywhere. They tried with th facelife to infuse some right angles in the front but it's the sides of the car and the tail that lack any character at all. It's far too smooth - too 1980s for me.

The TL's flying wedge design seems more Audi mixed with Alfa than the sexiness of the original Acura Legend. That car still draws my eyes every time I see one (much like the second gen integra and vigor still make me look). Can't explain it but the TL almost seems like some wacky european film set designer for a cheap sci-fi film said, ""I vill make future car"" and out popped the TL with its hard angles, square taillights and rectangluar exhaust ports. Long, low, wide and most spaceshippy in that dark gray color. i see it and think of Dr. Evil saying with pride, ""What do you think of your quasi-futuristic [car], Mr. Powers?""

3 series, except front, looks like Korean or Japanese compact. I guess that you can still have a good performing car, such as WRX, but don't have to have good styling.

That's what drives my purchase. The exterior of the car doesn't influence my purchase. For god's sake i owned a Protege until last month.

People will still buy it for performance, which is understandable, but will close eyes on styling. Some auto magazine writers also not so excited about new 3 style.

I'm not closing my eyes. It just doesn't matter to me. I can't grasp the rancor over the GTO or the hype surrounding the Solstice. the same question comes back: ""But how does it drive?""

3843,chris65amg,"July 24, 2005 2:18PM","However, it's amazing that BMW is still able to hold the small luxury/sport sedan crown. The fact that the competition has caught up is mostly because they are trying to implement a lot of the same ideas. Look at the last IS300. I don't think that the I-6 was a mistake.... look at the G35. Infiniti took almost an American approach, viz more horsepower. They've been trying for years and years. If they didn't start putting the heat on, then I'd be worried. It's not that the 3-Series isn't the best drive, or that it isn't the most fun, it's just that BMW got a little out of hand with the pricing. Bring it down a few K's, and they'll be raving again.

Hmm. Time for my styling critique.

3-Series: the older ones look aggressive. Kind of like they'll jump out and take a hunk out of a passerby's leg. The curvier shape of the new one looks a little blobby. Still a hell of a drive, though.

G35: suffers from what I call ""lack of style"": namely that it doesn't have a lot going on, especially from the side view, where it looks rather like a loaf of bread. That's the coupe. The sedan looks classier, especially in black, but still not a heart-stopper.

CTS: No comment :P

IS: Talking about the new one. It looks classy, but kind of boring. Not in a bad way, but it looks like a Lexus. Better than the G35 or CTS, but I honestly think that the TL looks better. Or rather, it's a mood thing. The TL is the wacky little sister who listens to new age, and the IS is the adult sis who listens to soft rock.

TL: a little crazy, but it works. I like the fact that Honda took a styling chance when they didn't have to. Kudos. I like the way it looks weird. This car, however, does not look as good in black as most of the others, probably since a nice silver would accentuate its creases better.

A4: The front end looks good ( I like the new grille). The back doesn't. Too boring."

I think it looks kinda tough, and my Mom shied away from it for that reason, but I wouldn't love my TL any less if my Mom had one. It's one of the few cars that truly balances luxury and performance. She'd get it for the luxury features, including the logical voice-recognition that'd make her car-rides more enjoyable. I got it for that too, but more for its power and handling.

One last travel tip for the folks here....especially those that like to travel. You have to consider visiting China.

Incredible to see not only the historic and ancient China (ie TerraCotta Warriors of Xian)...but to see the incredible industrialization. I never seen so many cranes in action in any city.

I greatly prefer firm seating. My couches were custom made so that I sit atop the leather...not down and wrapped up in it. Same with the leather in bmws/mbs/and audis....sit atop the seat.

Less leg support? My 330i's lower seat cushion extends to under my thighs nicely. If you mean lateral leg support, I have no idea what that would feel like. I'm five-seven and 145 lbs so I can't comprehend jokes about narrow airplane seats or the G35's controls digging into the thigh...I'd have to grow by a factor of two to have my thighs ever touch the lateral thigh supports on any car's seats.

Actually, softer seating provides better support than firm. I found this out when bed-shopping. It was pointed out that softer beds that conform to your body are better at supporting your natural arches/curves, whereas firmer beds force your body to conform more to them.

Regardless, having switched from a Passat (interior is very similar to Audi) to a TL, I understand what you are saying, and while the TLs seats don't bother me, I agree with your assessment re sitting on the seat v. in the seat. You might want to check out Cadillac's offerings and see what their seating is like.

I don't recall how BMWs seats were, but in general, German cars have firmer seats. If the price/size ratio (German cars in the same price-range as their Japanese & American counterparts are generally smaller (eg. BMW 3-series, Audi A4 v. TL, G35, CTS)) isn't working for you, you might want to look at the VW Passat. You'll lose some handling, but the new one should put out about 250/270 hp (you could try to find a used Passat v8, too), and have the seats you prefer.

3896,taxesquire,"August 1, 2005 2:41PM","Claimed horsepower is going down?

This lay-person's explanation: There's a new way to measure HP, and this new calculation is resulting a lower number.

Don't know whether they're taking into account ground friction, wind resistance, or what."
3897,gordonwd,"August 1, 2005 4:48PM","The SAE has basically revised the rules on how HP is measured on the dyno to try to make the numbers more realistic. IOW, they try to keep the dyno-geeks from ""cheating"" a bit to get their numbers up.

This has already been done in the past. Back in my early days in the industry (1960s), engines were tested on a dyno with everything possible done to maximize the horsepower. This included running with open pipes, no air cleaner, no accessories (i.e. power steering pump or alternator), no fan, etc., etc. If you look at the old HP ratings of 60s and 70s muscle cars, you'll see that 350 - 400HP and more were common ratings. By today's standards, with engines realistically dressed out, these engines would be rated 100 - 150HP lower."
3898,darrenw,"August 1, 2005 5:02PM","For people in the habit of thinking about SAE net horsepower, or old musclecar enthusiasts accustomed to SAE gross numbers, looking at real-world rear-wheel horsepower can be quite a wake-up call. This 1970 Charger makes an excellent example. Its 318 was factory rated in 1970 at 230 horsepower (SAE gross). But on the dyno it came just short of 150 horsepower (corrected rear-wheel). As a very general rule, rear-wheel horsepower on a manual-transmission car is about 15% less than SAE net, and rear-wheel horsepower on an automatic-transmission car is about 20% less than SAE net."
3899,darrenw,"August 1, 2005 5:44PM","For the 2006 model year, all Acura horsepower and torque specifications have been updated to reflect revised Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J1349 (Rev 8/04) net calculations that went into effect in January of 2005.

3900,geebee4,"August 4, 2005 6:30PM","I'm also thinking of switching from a Passat to TL; what was your experience with the TL? The BMW 325i is tempting, but I always go with the practical car and reliability is important. The 2006 Passat sounds good, also; too many decisions."
3901,taxesquire,"August 4, 2005 9:55PM","I love my TL, and I never regret switching from a Passat to a TL. That being said, let me be nitpicky. 1stly, I had a Passat GLX 5MT. Meaning it was a 6 cyl engine with all the amenities standard. I now have a 6MT TL w/ Nav.

I believe the Passat is gonna have about 250 hp, so it's #s will be comparable to the TL, and it might even have more low-end torque, it could be faster 0-30. No way the Passat will handle as well as the TL, though, making the TL a lot more fun to drive. Both interiors are well done - the TL seems a notch above, even though the Passat had real wood and the TLs is fake. If you're going manual transmission, the TLs is by far more enjoyable. I love the early clutch engagement and it shifts very smoothely.

As far as luxury features that I use, it's pretty close. The TLs nav makes it much, much better than the Passat, IMO. But if you're comparing non-nav vehicles, other than a 6-disc changer, I'm not sure what luxury features the TL has that the Passat doesn't. One is that the TLs lights shut-off automatically. Also, I like that the TL doesn't have a loud ""ding"" to let you know you're low on fuel. I'd often find myself driving where the tank is just at the cutoff level and the light would go on and off, dinging each time. I also like the TLs auto-a/c better. For some reason, the Passat's would always be 1 level too strong for me. The 1 thing that drove me crazy about the Passat was the steering wheel radio controls. The buttons should be on the left and the station changer should scroll the presets - VW got it backwards.

Here are some things I miss from the Passat: the key integrated fob (TL uses a separate FOB and regular key); electric fold-in mirrors; rear sunshade; rain-sensing wipers. Also, the Passat had nicer computer controls b/c (1) there were 2 sets of settings (TL has 1); (2) you didn't need to take your hand off the wheel to scroll through the options; (3) the Passat gave you more info on each screen; (4) the TL makes you hit a ""display"" button to display mpg, ave mph, etc.

As far as differences that aren't good or bad, the Passat's seats are more firm, the TL's are softer.

Frankly, from what I'v heard of the '06 Passat, it might be a tough deciding between the 2, but I'd expect the TL to give you a better value b/c Passats will probably go for MSRP initially.

To sum up, if you have a top-of-the-line Passat and enjoy it, but want something a tad more luxurious and a lot more sporty, you'll love the TL. If you're all about comfort and convenience, but won't get the nav, it might be close, and there will be some things you miss about the Passat.

Hope this helps!!! Sorry it's so long."

3903,klpeel,"August 5, 2005 1:14AM","One thing I might add in the Passat's favor (I just moved from a 2000 GLX to a 2005 G35x): the Passat can come with AWD, something the TL doesn't have. If it did, the TL might have been my choice instead of the G35x."

As far as I am concerned my INFINITI G35 is worth more then $17,000 ! What makes your BMW worth more ? Is it because it is German engineered ? there is nothing special there esp. since INFINITI ranked # 1 in relibality i believe last year ? could be wrong ....

Blueguydotcom sorry about the CAPS but I dont know just didn't bother to switch well anyway even without all the crap there is still a difference in the price between the BMW and the INFINITI .. A nice size one .

And the Bang for the Buck yes I understand not everyone is looking for that and either was I and I dont need too but as far as I am concerned I will continue to buy into the INFINITI name plate because they are great looking cars, great acting cars, relibale cars and worth the money and if it was all about a name plate my three car garage would have Mercedes - Benz written all over it ! But then agian it is just an opinion .

One last thing you have to remember that The new 325I and 330I was aimed at the INFINITI G35 and that the G35 was aimed at the older 2005 and before model. Therefore I think there will be a crown toss between INFINITI and BMW for many years to come not to say ACURA and AUDI and MB wont come out with future great products !

Shrug. don't have any use for bmw's premium package. to each his own. I see a 5k difference. For me, I'd rather pay 5k extra and be happy. I'm not happy with a G35...sit's too high, snap oversteer isn't my bag, engine's rough, shifter's not that great.

2. The premium package IS full of ""interesting gizmos"".

3. Comparably equipping cars is subject to personal tastes so its no more a persuasive argument that simply insulting the other guy's intelligence...
Compare the price difference between the base G35 and MY choice of BMW:
325i (Not drag racing for pinks, so excess engine output is just increasing our dependence on imported oil and shrinking my wallet.)
Jet Black paint (no add'l cost, and looks better than most metallic paints.)
Manual tranny (DSGs are nice, but I still want greater clutch control. No one should drive an automatic without a doctor's excuse.)
Sports Package (Just really like everything in it.)
Xenon headlights (Tired of being blinded by on-coming traffic? Return the favor!)
MSRP: $32,700 + destination.

The reason I didn't get the G35 was the lack of options. There was simply no way to get the price down for those of us who don't want bloated cars. $250.00 off for going with the manual? That's ridiculous. The dealers don't improve things: every G35 on every lot within 100 miles had the premium package. Yeah, with the G you get more car. (Whether you want it or not!)

""The new 325I and 330I was aimed at the INFINITI G35""

The new 3 was ""aimed at"" drivers. Despite what the ads may imply, BMW isn't interesting in copying others -- only improving on what came before. It's Infiniti and Lexus who feel compelled to ""aim"" at a competitor's product.

3950,nyrefugee,"August 17, 2005 5:28PM","""The coupes have too much chassis flex. ""

I am very surprised to hear this. In my experience the coupes have almost no chasis flex. This is because the FM platform is really solid, and the coupe bodystyle further reverses flex. You can read reviews of the g35 and the 350z (which has the fm platform as well) and most of them, even one review that slammed the 350z say that the FM platform was great and allowed no chasis flex or squirm. As I said that has been my experience as well, especially now that I am driving the car in the pothole filled streets of LA I find that the chasis does not twist and squirm even when i hit the big potholes.

It is possible that the car you drove had something disconnected or lose that made noise, which sounded like chasis flex.

The problem is that the FM platform is made out of steel, so it makes the car comparatively heavy. It is not that heavy compared to other cars of its class, but it is a pig compared to small sports cars, i.e. s2000s and miatas. The G35 would so much better if its body was made of aluminum but I am sure that would make it much more expensive too.

""And in the G35c outward vision is compromised too much.""

That is only true in the back. And you can get good vision in the back if you are very careful about setting up your side mirrors. But I admit, this car definately needs bigger mirrors.

""perfect comfort, poise, power, handling, reliability.""

For me the G has everything sans the comfort. The comfort is not perfect due to the hard suspension (I have a coupe with all suspension packages). But it is not easy for a car with good handling to have perfect comfort. Actually, it i pretty much impossible. But th G coupe is very comfortable for a car that handles the way it does."
3951,nyrefugee,"August 17, 2005 5:38PM","""If the IS350 loaded costs 30k,""

It wont. The 350 will be expensive. Probably in the 40s decently equipped. There will be a cheaper version (IS300 or 250 was it) which has a choice of manual but it will have a weaker 215 hp engine.

Dont be confused by the 300 hp engine ... the IS 350 will not be a sports or ""sporty"" car because no lexuses are. The LExus strategy is luxury and isolation from the environment. That is exactly the opposite as a sports car which must strive to make you one with the road.

So I am not at all surprised they do not offer a manual. They are just not selling to the sports car buyer. They are selling to the person that feels good about having a 300 hp car, but does not drive it hard or care about how it handles, rather he/she cares mostly about the luxury. I.e. it will be aimed at the same demographic as the TL."

If you head to www.Lexus.com and look at the new IS video it says that the IS250 ( the cheaper model ) will start around the same price of the current IS300.

Geez, I think our 3.8 liter V6 Dodge Grand Caravans are both faster than a 1984 Corvette (in a straight line that is), so a 2005 V6 Mustang beating that same Vette should be no trick.

Relative to the IS, I'm thinking it is a tad overweight for the size of the vehicle. True, I haven't seen it yet however it is weighing in at over 150 pounds more than an E90 325i, and it sounds like it has a smaller interior (in terms of legroom) than anything else in the class, consider the following:

Vehicle ---------- Total Leg Room ------------ Vehicle Weight
Audi A4 2.0T --------- 75.60"" ------------------------ 3,362 lbs.
BMW 325i ------------- 76.10"" ------------------------ 3,285 lbs.
Infiniti G35 ------------ 77.20"" ------------------------ 3,512 lbs.
Lexus IS250 ---------- 74.50"" ------------------------ 3,450 lbs (approx. the IS350 is 3,527)

Engine specs weren't finalized, but we managed to extract figures from chief engineer Suguya Fukusato that are pretty close. The smaller six will generate about 220 horsepower and 184 pound-feet; the larger six should pump out a healthy 310 horsepower and 266 pound-feet. No official acceleration figures are available, but our unofficial stopwatch clocked the IS350 at 5.9 seconds from 0 to 62 mph, in stark contrast to the 2.5-liter's 7.3-second sprint. Power is instant and progressive, offering a far more compelling experience than its predecessor. We hit an indicated 165 mph in the IS350 and 149 mph in the IS250.

Again, no one here is claiming that manuals are inherently faster 0-60 than automatics (but if your interest lies in keeping the RPMs at a 'steady boil' when braking into a turn, you'd be better off picking your own gears and finessing the clutch than fighting with the transmission as it tries to up-shift when you let off the gas.

I feel confident that a 5 speed automatic would be clearly faster than a manual of the same car driven by myself. :blush: But taking out the human error is what makes the car less sporty.

It's not so much whether you can lay out the dough to buy a fast car - it's whether you personally can make any particular car operate at its best, regardless of whether that means keeping rpms down to stretch every last ounce of gas or running right up to the redline. I'd think I'd get more satisfaction out of maximizing the HP in a manual 4 cylinder Honda Accord than just slamming my foot down on an automatic Porsche Boxter.

Think about Nascar - the argument that it's not a sport is based on the fact that it mainly involves machines, and the best machine will win. Pro-Nascar arguments revolve around the human interaction - when to slow down, when to accelerate, when to block an opposing car, the pit crew, etc. Automatics take a level of involvement out of the equation and lessen the ""sport"" of the whole thing."

Almost no one can shift a manual as fast as SMG (dah, that's why they invented SMG in racing); few can shift manual faster than a modern automatic for that matter.

3993,gordonwd,"August 18, 2005 7:29PM","I read an interesting explanation the other day about why mag testers such as C&D can usually get better 0-60 times that the manufacturer's rating. It has to do with exactly how the measurement is taken. Apparently, most of the magazines use a technique that was developed by the NHRA (the drag racing sanctioning body), where they start the timer when the car has moved one foot -- not at the exact instant of when it starts to move. Now you might ask how big a deal one foot is, but you would be surprised how long that takes -- it is of course the slowest one foot of the entire run, especially considering what it takes to overcome the inertia of geting the car to start moving.

As another example, I used to drive a front-engine dragster that would run the 1/4-mile in about 7.5 seconds. One time, though, I popped the front wheels so that they went over the starting beams and I started the timers with my rear wheels instead of the front wheels. So I basically got a 170"" head start on the clock. My elapsed time on that run was 6.8 seconds, which would have been good for a world record if it had been a legitimate time!"
3994,ivorypearlg,"August 18, 2005 7:33PM",Also about the 0-60 times 5.6 seconds for what the 6-spd manual 330I ? Well in the new comparo in the Automobile mag says that the New 2006 BMW 330I 6-SPD does 0-60 in 6.1sec... That is slower then the Infiniti G35 6-SPD going 0-60 in 5.8 sec. Then the last one was with the 6-SPD Caddy CTS moving 0-60 in 6.5 sec.
3995,kdshapiro,"August 18, 2005 7:53PM","You know what, you can cite all the comparos in the world, it doesn't change the basic fact the Infiniti with a bigger engine, more hp and torque cannot really outgun the 330i. So you can cite this comparo, I'll cite the other comparo."
3996,kdshapiro,"August 18, 2005 7:54PM",Really? You think? You should see them race. Unfortunately I have. Accord loses. Mine is faster than both of them anyway.
3997,kdshapiro,"August 18, 2005 7:58PM","Some mags pop the clutch or use torque braking.

While the numbers the mags get usually are representative of the best times you could achieve, you will rarely hit those numbers unless you wish to damage your drivetrain.

I think though it's important that each mag sticks with their established method, so one can compare times.

However, I would never do a full torque brake launch with my auto tranny."

I agree with you that the G has a bigger engine, more power etc, but the fact remains that the G is quicker to the 330. And with around a 10k advantage too. The gas mileage sucks but you gotta pay somewhere."
4000,03accordman,"August 18, 2005 8:07PM","again, a V6 accord stick would out gun any 325 stick to 60 (not comparing the cars in any manner!). Accord coupe has been timed in the high 5s to 60 by many magazines/testers."

4004,fedlawman,"August 18, 2005 8:12PM","The Infiniti, even with almost 50 hp more than the BMW, still manages to be a mere 0.3 secs faster to 60 MPH and through the 1/4 mile?!?!

I don't know about you, but I can't tell 0.3 secs from the seat of my pants, and dynamically, the 330i blows the G35 away in terms of ride, steering, and poise.

The G35 offers tremendous performance/luxury bang for the buck, but in my opinion, the 330i is the superior drivers car."
4005,ivorypearlg,"August 18, 2005 8:16PM","Well I think the G has great ride even thou I have a 03 coupe, but when I went in for a scheduled service they gave me a G35X and the ride was great.

I am looking to get a 325 in the near future, and went to take a peek a few days back. The car looks gorgeous to me, but the rear seat is too small and low for an adult to sit comfortable, and this is a requirement for me. I will go again this weekend for a second look and then decide."

My take is they are not shying away from it, but you're not going to see a high powered engine in a $30K automobile.

Regarding some 0-60 times. I will grant you, some mags post impressive times from autos you wouldn't expect.

So I amend my statement to read, the BMW will loose them as soon as the other vehicle goes to turn the wheel."

4018,bmwe90,"August 18, 2005 8:53PM","I purchased an Infiniti G35 :lemon: soon after they were released. It was in the shop for 69 days within the first 8 months of ownership. Nissan was horrible to deal with in any respect. I like to think of it this way: McDonalds can hype up their hamburgers calling them ""premium"" (like they do everything) and the numbers are there to support it - you get 6 whole oz. of beef - a whole ounce more than the competition. But then you realize the competition is a 5 diamond restaurant offering a burger as well - you can see where I'm going. I recently purchased a new 3 series. It easily makes it way to 100 without the steering wheel shaking as in the G. the wind doesn't whistle through the cut rate seals on the doors as it did in the G, and finally when I brake, I get smooth, modulated pedal action which brings me to a quick stop. In the G, the whole car shook from the severely warped rotors which they tried to fix on more than 5 occasions. So if you value smooth and quick acceleration, a solidly built car, and powerfully smooth brakes, by all means spend the few extra bucks and purchase the 3. If you can live with the fact that you paid almost as much for a car that is manufactured by a company who's claim to fame is the Sentra - and you dont mind cost cutting measures literally surrounding you - choose the G. In defense of the G, It is probably the car that comes the closest to the Bimmer as far as handling, but it has a long, long way to go before many people would choose it over a 3 series."

I think the fact that lexus has only one vehicle which we can really consider ""performance oriented"" while BMW has not only numerous performance oriented vehicles (any of the larger output engines on all series) but several ""super high performance"" vehicles (M3, M5, & M6) indicates that lexus is trying its best to get a foot in the proverbial door.

I can say the same about my 330i. 4 months and BMW's current ""solution"" for the common 3.0 4k engine hesitation is rather draconian: they disable the second set of valves so the engine loses top end power. But it no longer hesitates, they said to me with a straight face. Great, I've been to BMW 4 times in 4 months and this is their solution for a known problem with the 3.0 engine?

By the time the GTR comes around BMW will be out with a 600+hp monster. Of course you may be paying $6/gallon to fill up the GT-R or 600hp monster, but that's another story.

What a company has done in the past helps it's future. I'm sure you would like to see BMW lose, but it's probably not gonna happen.

Uh-hu, not buying. My bet is that it's not the car it's the tires. If his 330i is horrible then it has the summer performance tires, which BMW overtly states should not be used in the winter. If his car does not have the Sport Package and has the OEM All-Season rubber then you are overstating the case. My first BMW was a 328i with almost identical rubber as a 330i non-SP, and while it wasn't the best car I've ever driven in the white stuff, it was certainly capable of getting from point A to point B with a minimal amount of fuss. I then got a 530i SP and ""YIKES"", that thing was horrible in even a bare dusting of snow. Remember I stated ""...it's the tires""? Well I put a dedicated set of winter skins on my 530i and Presto-Chango, my car went from the worst winter car I've ever driven to the absolute best, FWD cars included.

What's that you say? I don't live in Maine? You're right, I live in New Hampshire, and over the last three winters we've had over 300 inches of snow. Through it all my 530i only stayed in the garage when the snow was so deep that it would have been nothing more than a snow plow if I'd taken it out. That said, six to eight inches of rutted snow was no problem, even with all of the undulating roads (vertically and horizontally) that we have around here.

But if you asked me if i made the logical and practical decision at the time - I would say yes, of course. From what I gather from the many happy G owners on this board, Infinti does, in most cases, provide a great handling, midsize car for a good sum of $ less than BMW's 3 series. If I hadn't had my sour experience with Infiniti, and I were in the market for a sport sedan - and money was a consideration (as it is for most of us) the G would definently be on my shopping list. The higher price of the 3 series does pose a problem for some buyers in this category, and at any rate, the G provides more interior room than even the new 3. I agree with you that these two cars are serving different targets, but those targets aren't too far apart. I did spend 35,000 miles behind the wheel of my G before it was gone. I have spent about 4k miles in my new 3 and the cars each have their strengths - along with very few weaknesses. I will give you guys/gals my honest opinion of each car (I'll pretend for fairness sake that nothing was wrong with my G)

The G was very quick with it's 260 hp and torque. The car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesn't match BMW for handling at high speeds (90+). the BMW seems more at home the harder you push it while the Infiniti feels like it's up to the task, but it does it with a straight face while the BMW does it with a smile. The BMW has the better interior hands down, quality wise, I wont comment on style because that very objective. The BMW is a tigher squeeze though, and most taller passengers will be asking the driver and font passenger to move up. It seems once you get situated in the BMW, no one complains from lack of space. The Infinti's rear doors open much much wider than the bimmers, though - and the seats also recline in the G. The engines are a tossup, I think the inline 6 is smoother than the v6 in the infiniti but i will agree that infiniti's v6 is probably the second best engine I have ever owned. The transmission in the BMW has an extra gear and seems to shift smoother and quicker. I had a full size spare in my G and I loved it. I don't like the new run flats on my 3. I prefer the BMWs brakes though. BMW does include maintenance, which is nice- but not a deal maker in any respect.

They are both great performers and I think anywho who choses either is getting one of the best sport sedans available in this class."

Yesterday there was a pre-'06 330 in our parking lot with a Mazda 3 sedan behind it. I actually found the Mazda 3 to have a bit more panache! The new BMW 3, thankfully has been toned down, although the rear is straight off a second gen Infiniti G20. The resytled 7 looks significantly better, the 5 has grown on me. But so did the CTS and Aztek! But only slightly...

The G35 sedan is OK stylewise, I'm not a big fan of the rear and it seems a bit ""tall and narrow"" to me. But the G35 coupe, like the BMW 3 series coupe I find to be works of art, exterior style-wise. YMMV."

I agree exactly with that assessment. But I also love the new looks. They are very striking and have a great presence. The M6 especially is a head turner, the new M6 convertible. /me wants

The new designs have taken some bad press. But in the real world, where people actually vote with their wallets, the designs actually seemed to be like. It amazes me when I talk to people there are some who didn't like the old, but love the new.

I agree it's more expensive, but everybodys definition of value is different. And that's what this conversation is about. Yes gas price shouldn't matter, but the fact is with a smaller engine and less hp and power, the 3 series holds it's own against the G. Most magazines consider the new 3 the new benchmark.

However, having said that, there are real reasons for looking at other manufacturers. BMW has always been the drivers benchmark, which is one reason I am interested in them. I don't care for the other stuff such as DVD-A, nav etc, give me a well tuned creamy smooth vehicle that almost drives me and I am happy.

Have you ever driven a BMW? If not you should get yourself in for a test drive. Maybe you have and were unimpressed. That's okay with me. I don't have to defend the car. There are legions of reviews that seem to indicate that BMW has done right with the E90.
Here's one of them. Maybe they are in the business of selling cars and they needed to change with the times to suit their broadest audience without compromising their mission of the ""Ultimate Driving Machine"".

Yes, BMW does great marketing, but they also market a superlative product. Sounds like there's a subtext in your post, almost wishing the Japanese knew how to do the same thing.

In general car manufacturers are ignoring the $3/gallon price per gas, hoping that we won't notice either. People who say when you buy a sports sedan you give up rights to good mileage are just blowing smoke. BMW and Acura manage to squeeze decent mileage in both city and highway.

A cars job is to take one from place to place. Lots of cars fulfull that and don't even cost $15K. A $35K car is an indulgence. People on these boards often end up heatedly discussion which indulgence is less indulgent. As if to justify their purchase.

""but I just can't justify the cost over the G35 coupe, ""

I understand that also. Many whiles back a Honda S2000 owner said of a Ferrari: ""Why would I want one, I got a car that performs almost as well for a fraction of the price and is totally reliable"" You're the same way, the diminishing returns you get from an M3 is not worth it."

In that segment 30 mpg on the freeway is viewed as reasonable as the cars also have luxury (absent from a prius), handling (absent from a prius) and power (totally absent from a prius).

I have driven an 04 Prius (current body style). It scared me! There was a crosswind and that egg-shaped, high-riding car with almost zero tire connection to the road felt like it was going to flip. Doing 80 on the freeway was a chore and at that speed - normal freeway speed, not even normal long distance drive speed - the gas mileage was less than stellar. I can only guess how horrid my mileage would be running 95-100 down I-5 to SF ior I-15 to Vegas. Would it even get in the 30s?

I know I can get 30+ running 95-100 in my 330i. And the car feels firmly planeted. And I'm only using 2/3rds of the engine's potential, so the car still has the gumption to scoot if I need it. Otherwise it's just leisurely zipping along - quiet, secure, agile still and totally luxurious."

That is exactly ""it"". We are talking about 3 to 3.5L 6 cylinder engines that power cars that weigh between 3200/3300 to 3500/3600 (just a guess). At this weight point and engine size there is a reasonable expectation of decent gas mileage if you have the ability to cruise at an even pace down the freeway. There also is an expection of reasonable gas mileage if you live in a congested area like I do. Along with reasonable gas mileage there is an expectation of snappy acceleration and crisp handling.

The TL and 3 fulfill the expectation of reasonable gas mileage, and that is where the G falls short relative to these two cars. It's just one of the criteria one looks at when choosing a car."

The manufacturers don't even market them based on the mileage factor. Imagine a BMW ad "".....Get the new 3 series, the most fuel efficient car in it's class"". These cars are Sport Coupes (or Sedan) . Not economy cars. They are about sportiness, that is styling, handling, power, speed, ride, gadgets, and toys. Even at todays gas prices that is how I still see my G35 coupe....even though I walked away from the pump the last time with a sigh I still powered it down the highway after leaving the gas station.

I bought my G35 Coupe based on styling, power, ride, fun to drive, gadgets, falls within my budget. I like myu cars to have a nice interior but I was willing to settle with the interior of the G35 considering all the other plus factors. In addition, every other Joe in my neighbourhood has a 3 series. Now that I am seeing the G35 Coupe everywhere I go I want to change it again, but I would probably go more for a CLK because it has really good features and it is not as popular as some other cars and it wouldn't be for the gas mileage.

When I was picking up my ED 530i I spent the first 1,300 miles or so keeping the car under 100 mph, and during that most critical of break in periods I obtained between 26 and 28 mpg. For the last sprint back into Munich I had the cruise control set at 130 and according to the trip computer I was still getting between 23 and 24 mpg. Geez, my 530i was getting about the same mileage at a buck thirty that a G35 gets at half that speed.

Now, being one that habitually refutes anecdotal evidence, I must admit that over the last seven years of contributing here in the TownHall I seen literally hundreds of posts by BMW 3-Series and 5-Series drivers claiming mileage well beyond the EPA numbers (and precious few that couldn&#146;t). Once again, in my mind that is significant. In fact, a few months ago in the 5-Series forum, a contributer was complaining that his E39 530i was barely able to make the EPA numbers. The rest of us kept maintaining that there was something wrong with his car, contrary to what his dealer was telling him. I mentioned to him that I was aware that there was at least one round of firmware out of Munich that was, ummm, less than optimal, and suggested that he have his OBC reflashed. Bingo! He immediately started getting mileage more in line with what the rest of us had been telling him he should be experiencing, which by the way was well beyond the EPA numbers.

We hear can ignore fact that Nielsen predicts the habits of 35million people from 1000 people

There is a percentage of people who will hit the EPAs number because they drive the car exactly as it was tested. For the rest of us that don't drive as tested our actual mileage will vary + and -.

I posted this on over on the Mercedes boards (because that's where I started in research) - but after scanning for a while, found all the other boards - and THIS one is where I should have posted. Anyway... looking back, this board has a good balanced sense for these type of questions:

Right now, I drive a 2004 Volvo S60 T5. I'm trying to decide whether I want to purchase one of the new Mercedes-Benz C-class vehicles to replace it. The new engine/transmission combo for the 2006 C-class line is making me give it serious consideration. I'm trying to find out if there's enough benefit to make the move. I'd welcome all opinions!

The tough part is that the Volvo S60 T5 is perfectly fine. For some quick comparisons (the first number is the Volvo figure, the second is the 2006 MB C280):

Cylinders: 5 vs. 6
HP: 208 vs. 228 (2.5L vs. 3.0L)
Torque: 236 ft lbs 1500 RPM vs. 221 ft lbs 2700 RPM (the Volvo is turbocharged...)

I like the Volvo's ride, power, and smoothness. What I don't like is that the S60 is not quite as compact. The turning radius for the S60 is 38.7"" (the C280 touts 35.3"" - which would be better for me in the area I live). The width of the S60 is 71.4"" vs. the C280's 68.0"".

Yet these are minor points - given my car is only 2 years old.

Really ? There are two fallacies in this post. (1) That Lexus fanatics are *fuming*, and (2) that BMW fanatics don't seem to notice....

1) Lexus fanatics are NOT fuming, rather we recognize the vast superiority of the IS350 over the 330i. The numbers speak for themselves, or do you want me to post them for ya ? The tester Bimmer couldn't even make it through the test mechanically.... breaking down under its own weight

2) And Bimmer fans are slowly but surely waking up to the new C&D review. Just wait until it is widely available on newstands. I don't think most BMW officianados ever imagined an entry level Lexus to do a 5.1s 0-60, and a 13.7s @ 104mph to the 1/4-mile ??? An e90 cannot even approach these numbers. And that is an auto tranny IS350 going against a 6MT 330i. Just imagine the IS with a 6MT ?????? And the difference b/w these two cars, according to C&D ? 1 pt separating 1st from 2nd !!! That is a virtual tie. Maybe BMW needs to be more concerned that teir tester car proved to be unreliable when faced with its peers.

If you would know how to drive, I assume you don't according to your post, you would not brag about those numbers. What important is driving dynamics, look at Skidpad and slalom.

It's faster than your S60, which you said is fast enough, but it's size is more similar to the Mercedes. It might be the perfect combo for you. I test drove an S40, and think I would've been happy with it, but it was too small. Also, while your post doesn't discuss luxury features, if you're a luxury-feature kinda guy, the S40 might fall short there, too.

BGDC: On the face of it, that an unreliable BMW beat out a new IS350 smark of conspiracy, don't ya think ? Let's see, of the 3 major cateogries - vehicle, powertrain and chassis, the IS350 beat out the 330i in 2 of 3 (vehicle and powertrain), but lost in the chassis category. Hmmm ! The IS350 is a better car where it matters, vehicle (fit-and-finish, ergonomics, style, etc) and powertrain (performance, engine flexibility, tranny, etc). Gotta-have-it-factor: dead tie. Fun-to-drive: 23-to-22, a virtual tie. So how exactly did this broken down, unreliable e90 win ? And if you die-hard fanatics cannot even see that these two cars are a virtual tie, you must have more denial than I think...

But more to your point: We all know how much these auto rags rave about the 3-series as the benchmark of BMW automotive engineering excellence. To beat that car will take a herculian task. And the IS350 did, even with a slushbox ! The measured (objective and subjective) difference b/w the e90 and the IS350 is infinitesimal, at best... virtual tie at worst. That it took Lexus 6 years to beat the vaunted 3-series is what counts, not the unreliability of the Bimmer or the money flush at Toy/Lexus. At least, they put their money where their mouth is."

But even though the magazine touted the G as being a ""BMW beater"", they confessed that the only reason the BMW lost was because it was priced higher than a comparably equipped G.

Ward's list = PR crap. It's as worthless as a magazine comparo. They put the VQ on there too and ever since Nissan bumped displacement from 3.0 to 3.5 that engine's been a NVH nightmare (at least in my experience with that rough, ratchety engine)."

I'll say it again: the new IS350 is a 3-er beater. It comes with everything you'd need to kick the 330i, even when mated to a slush box, it still outruns all the MT sedans in its class. But its not just about speed, is it ? Its braking is best-in-class, its interior ergonomics is better than the e90, its exterior style is equally better, its handling is about even, and its ride is a tad lower than the e90 (w/non-sport version IS350 v sport-tuned 330i). In the fun-to-drive category, it is a virtual tie with the e90, and in the gotta-have-it both cars are a dead tie. How hard are these stats to digest for y'all ???? Oh, it promises to be more reliable, more safe, and we already know it is the fastest naturally aspirated V6 car in the entry-lux sport sedan class. A 5.1s to 60 is unbelievable, and doing a 13.7s to 1/4-mile has to be even more outstanding. But who cares, eh ? Oh, the IS350 is 52/48, while the e90 is 50.7/49.3; these two are the most balanced in the entire class...

If HP alone is your game you will never win, because someone will always have more HP.

If BMW ever looked down their nose at Lexus, they must be celebrating with champagne at this latest comparo. Even though the car had some issues, it still came out on top. Now where is the 3.5L twin-turbo?

Note: I too find 5.1 unbelievable, but I wonder how many times that can be done without the tranny falling out. :lemon It still is remarkable, though not unexpected. 0-60 times have been inching down for the last few years.

You are right though in one thing – none of the bmw ""Aficionados"" posting here have provided a SINGLE stat to back their statement about how the Bimmer is better than the IS. Well… maybe because it is useless to defend something that you simply love and enjoy driving? I don’t see any point in it. But to answer your statement about bmw handling (“same ol' same ol' … how BMW is such a great handling car… blah blah blah..”) I guess I just remembered how I measured the handling once. I was driving my friend’s Lexus (nice comfortable car) and turned steering wheel slightly and anticipated (actually needed) that the car will start turning. I turned the steering wheel a good, I’d say, 10 maybe 13 degrees. Well, needless to say, the car kept going straight. At the same speed and turning bmw’s steering wheel the same number of degrees, bmw actually responds. That is why I personally prefer bmw because of its handling and other things.
But in no way I am saying that my car is better or, God forbids, beats yours! I am just saying that I like my car for characteristics that have values to me and you probably like your car for some other characteristics that have values to you. We just have different values

Like I said, BMW execs are certainly not taking Lexus lightly, but it'll take you guys a while to come to that reality. So continue your head-in-the-sand folly.

In 1990 the LS400 undercut the price of the nearest BMW/MBs by over 10k. They got in on price and ability. The LS400 was more reliable and almost as nice as the BMW/MB counterparts. But it had a massive ace up its sleeve...the price was so scary low (35k!) that people had to look.

This is the tactic Infiniti took with the G35. Offer 90%- 95% of the 3 series but at 5-7k lower. It's worked and the G35 has carved out a niche.

Will Lexus do this with the IS250/350? Indications are the IS250 will start at 30k. Stripped. No leather, no xenons, no moonroof. IS350 would probably be 34-36k (we'll know soon). As far as I can tell, to get xenon lights on the IS350 you must get the 3rd highest package and a moonroof is still an option. We know the cars will come with this stuff on lots so it's safe to say an IS350's gonna run over 38k msrp. I'm betting (given GS pricing differences between the 6 and 8) that the IS350 will start at 36-37k (just like the 330i). So I'm not expecting the IS350 to be less than a 330i.

Where's the value? The value proposition is what got Lexus where it is. Never forget that. Just like Hyundai, Lexus came up offering almost as much as the competition but for less money."

1. I find the Lexus 350 appealing.
2. With gas prices estimated to be going to $4/gallon, Toyota has picked a lousy time introduce what is probably a gas sucking sports sedan. Unless you don't drive as intended, this thing will suck gas. You cannot have blazing acceleration and blazing gas mileage simultaneously.
3. There seems to ""concerns"" with the bias of the C&D toward BMW, seemingly having a ""lesser"" car take the #1 spot.
4. There is no doubt the engine is bigger on the IS, but that doesn't make it a better sports sedan.
5. BMW is not *dead*.
6. It's going to take a fair number of reviews to see where the IS350 fits in the pecking order. When the G35, it was the ""king was dead"". Not even close for BMW. It beat BMW in every metric. As more comparos were done different results began to emerge.
7. The 5.1 to 60 is impressive no doubt. I wouldn't want to try that with my car though.
8. The HP and gas sucking wars are not over, BMW is rumored to be working on a 3.5L twin turbo engine.

They also mentioned that the engine , while powerful, is so quiet it's hard to hear except under hard acceleration. They also state that they felt the car had lost some of the edge of the IS300. Basically they are saying it's less of a drivers car than it needs to be to compete with the 3 series on those terms.

This all comes on the heels of a rather solid review of the E90. They had their nits to pick with it as well, but said its chassis makes up for a lot. Sounds like it's a very sharp-handling car. Can't wait to drive one.

Personally, I think the IS350 is a sharp-looking car, with a squat, muscular stance, but I can't understand why Lexus wouldn't offer a MT in a car they expect to compete with a drivers car like the E90.

Hmmm... I go through all the gears as fast as my right arm and left leg will allow. Pretty sure I wasn't shifting the any of the others any quicker. My procedure is:

a) Clutch pedal down, gas pedal up, and moving out of gear all at the same time.
b) When my clutch foot hits bottom it comes right up and I'd better be in the next gear (or there'll be Heck to pay!), as the left foot is coming up the right one is going down.

The M-B felt better, but I doubt if I was shifting it any faster.

With a grain of salt indeed ! Here are the actual scores for the 330i in the ""Vehicle"" category: 8+7+3+4+3+7+9+7+9+0+17= 74. But C&D gave it 75, to yield the 1pt margin of victory for the Bimmer.

You don't have to worry about me.

Since I now know that I'm not a driver (just a passenger) I decided to read the Wall St. Journal on the way to work, rather than pay attention to the road, steer, brake, accelerate or play with my TLs autostick. Well, after getting the car going in the right direction (weird, I was in the driver's seat and it seemed if I didn't use the steering wheel, accelerator and gear selector, the car wouldn't move!) I whipped out the WSJ and began reading. As my TL approached the 90 degree left turn on my street, the TL didn't turn!!! It went straight into my neighbor's yard! As if there was no driver! Funny, though. Every other morning, when I'm ""not driving"" the TL responds to my decisions and inputs using all the controls provided to ""drive"" the car. I'm so confused, could it be that manual or automatic or semi-automatic or some variation, we really are all drivers? :confuse:

Actually, I do understand what you ""Live Manual or Die"" guys are talking about. I'm just having some Internet fun... Well, I think it's fun...

For the first 15 years of my driving life, I was a die-hard 5 speed manual guy (Saab 99, VW Scirocco, Mitsubishi Mirage Turbo, Acura Integra). And then came the fateful day I was promoted into sales and inherited the Sales Manger's Olds (at 11,000 miles the gas tank ruptured a seam on the TOP of the tank!) and for the next 5 years, boring but servicable domestic, automatic sedans. I did however, teach the evil wife to drive a stick and bought her a Nissan Sentra SE - R (fun, fun, fun) followed by a Saab 900s (fun, very practical. My attempt to avoid an SUV or Minivan) as the family began to grow. These were mine to play with on the weekend. I ""retired"" (downsized ) from the sales game and bought my company Dodge Intrepid (nice car but very loud and not Honda build quality. But reliable and good looking, good in snow). I believed I would return to the land of the ""driver"" soon.

Once I began my second career, it was time for a new car. As I was now a commuter, evil wife suggested I drive the Saab for a month of commuting to ensure I wanted a stick. I was sure the commute wouldn't sway me away, I was wrong. It was just no fun shifting between 1-2-3 every 17 seconds, rarely getting above 40mph. After a week, I returned the Saab, bought a Chrysler 300M ( I can't believe I bought a first model year, domestic CHRYSLER! I broke every rule there!) and had a plan. The wife's next car would be a 5 speed (Saab 9-5 or maybe A4 Avant, possibly a BMW 3 wagon? I was looking forward to shopping for her) and I would continue my tradition of enjoying row your own boat driving on the weekend. Ah, but as is often the folly that is my grand planning, the wife said she was done with manuals, she commutes too and driving to her is just a necessary evil. Hence, the Saab turned into (what else?) a Lexus RX 300 as our family grew again. She's very happy, therefore I'm very happy.

Will there be a manual tranny again in my future? Who knows. Until then, I will continue to drive whatever I choose, understanding those that rhapsodize about their fabulous fifth to third slingshot passes on I95 or deftly selecting just the right gear for a sweeper on their favorite hometown back roads.

I also made ""speculative"" comments that were very favorable to the IS350, yet you didn't have any beef about that or copy/paste that. I guess if it's something positive about the IS, you're fine with it, but if it's negative, God forbid . . .

By the way, I stand by my comments. ZERO reviews so far have said that the IS350 sets the class standard in handling. We KNOW that the IS350 has less room than the G35, TL and even the 330i. And I will give you a COOKIE if the IS350 has better mileage than the 330i.

In the final analysis, the sales numbers will be all that counts...and I think the IS will be very successful.

I think C and D has a history of forgiving (overlooking) build and reliability flaws for cars that they love to drive. As its recent 50 year anniversary issue has pointed out, the mag basically started as an ode to British sports cars back in the '50s. And, as history has shown, we all know how reliable and well built British cars were! But they loved the driving experience, and that was the thrust of the relationship.

C and D noted the imperfections, and because of their respect for the marque, downplayed it as far as rating the new 3. IMHO, of course. What a cool comparo, there's a car there for everyone!

4329,kdshapiro,"September 5, 2005 7:52PM","""AWD: is not class important, just more hype from east-coasters, we in the left coast don't give a hoot about AWD.""

It may not be a priority on the west coast, but for some folks on the east it is. The snowy east coast is a huge market that can't be ignored. And if one looks around at the cars on the road the number of AWD drive cars is huge, not a small miniscule percentage.

""Ride and Handling: The Bimmer is good in this area, but skimps mightily in other areas.""

I agree with that. However, the reason I like BMWs is for what they *don't* put in a car in terms of luxo-items. I don't need Lexus-branded luxury nor do I want it. I find the cockpit of the 3 series to be very calming and reassuring.

""But the fact that the 330i HAD a mechanical issue should have automatically been factored into the comparo,""

The fact it had a mechanical issue has no bearing on the way the car was designed to ride and drive and does ride and drive. IMO this is what they are measuring. Truth-in-disclosure they didn't hide it under the rug. The reader can form any opinion they want on the mechanical issue."
4330,kdshapiro,"September 5, 2005 7:56PM","""And since the IS350 is the fastest naturaly aspirated V6""'

That statement is true for now. However, slightly OT, the BMW 3.2 liter I6 is the engine to beat in the naturally aspirated class. The base M3 which is a few thousand more (at $50K) than the 350 and 330i will obliterate the cars in this segment."

What is subjective about being charged more for ""keyless"" ignition that is really keyless?

You don't have to buy the car, if you don't like the vehicle options.

What is subjective about the maintenance issues plaguing these expensive cars?

Yes I agree. For the hundreds of thousands of BMWs out there, there will be some problems. No car is immune, the G35 has certainly had it's share as well. And let's not even talk about the Toyota/Lexus sludge and tranny issues. The BMW also has a B-B 4yr/50K free maintenance program along with the warranty.

My point, as it has always been, is that these cars should be considered from A to Z (as a total package). If reliability is not apparent, how can ""best in class"" even be on the radar?

Who said reliability is not apparent? Because a test car had a malfunction? That's like throwing the baby out with the bath water.

Beautiful build? I know it's subjective but man the Jetta is so ugly sandra bernhard was heard making fun of the car's appearance. Really, the Jetta GLI is outrageously bad looking in person. It looks like someone crossed a 4X4 with a pill bug.

Same performance? not really. The A3 has returned 6.3 0-60 sprints with DSG. The Jetta GLI is consistenly getting 6.7 and above.

As for handling there's no comparing them either. Yes, the have some of the same underpinnings but the displacement of the weight is different and the cars handle markedly different ways.

I have not driven the GTI yet but for now the next year or so it won't have the utility of the A3's 4 doors.

Very different cars. And the prices differences...aren't there. A3 with dsg, open sky and sport is about 30k. Same stuff on a Jetta GLI is 28k."

Translation:

A good 20 years after the entry of a turbo charger in the 745i for an increase in performance, BMW as of 2006 once again turns to the turbo in order to pry out more power.

The 335 makes its debut as the strongest Model of the 3er Series below the powerful M3. The nomenclature would lead one to err, as was the case in the 1980s.

Instead of a 3,5 l motor (literally ""equipment"") there is a 3 l straight 6 cylinder with two Turbochargers and piezo direct fuel injection by Siemens.

This will put out ca. 340 PS (horsepower). Visually the potent 3er will show its power with dual exhausts.

Along side the 3er we can expect an M version of the 1er and further BMW will test a 4 l V8 biturbo as well as a 2 l 4 cyl. turbo.

If that's true, I may have to return to bmw sooner than i originally planned. 340 hp and it's biturbo? Egad that thing'd smoke an e46 M3. And with biturbos one of my chief complaints about bmw (torque-less engines) will be answered. you gotta expect at least 300 ft-lbs of torque."

Do you have any idea why I'm not opting for a e90 330i?

1. Because only the handling is better than my e46's.
2. The setup's not as engaging as my e46 perf pack.
3. If i have to put up with how unreliable BMWs are, then I want the car to be ludicrously fun. An e90 is not ludicrously fun. Neither is my e46.

My plan, assuming an e90 335i is not announced, is to buy something simple and cheap - like an S2000 or Miata. I'll drive that for 2 or 3 years and wait for the e90 M3 sedan. The e90 M3 sedan, assuming it comes out, should satisfy me to a level of 91-92%.

The 335i allows me to avoid having something as garish as an M on my car and no ostentatious gills on the fenders. Plus the 335i would address something i hate about the current 3 series line up - no torque. I have stated several times I prefer VW's 2.0T to my e46's inline 6. I like the full blast of torque from 1800-5000 rpm. Having over 300 ft-lbs of torque over a broad range of the powerband in an e90 would suddenly take the decent car to a higher level - nice handling (ideally tightened up more for the 335i), matched to power for once.

The G35 is faster than an e46 and e90. So what, the car's got snap oversteer issues. I want the whole package. sublime handling, crazy power and 4 doors.

As for price, BMW bumped the price of the 325i to 330i about 4-5k. I'd hope the same bump would occur to the 335i and then the M3 would ring in at 50-55k starting. If I can outfit a 335i at 45k with just leather, sport, paint, I'll be happy."

You may not have M3 horsepower, but you also don't carry the extra 300 lbs., and you don't feel the road through wheels/tires that are almost a foot wide and weigh 50 lbs/corner!

The 65 mph speed limit thing is a weak argument position regarding hp. HP has little to do with top speed or acceleration. A car with 135 hp can break the limit without breaking a sweat.

There's nothing illegal about strongly accelerating away from the on-ramp stoplights or accelerating out of a corner strongly.

Excellent point. How many people with lots of HP under-utilize their vehicles in city/suburban mundane type of driving - going back and forth to work each day or out shopping. I suppose their answer is that they could go fast if they wanted to.

How many have lots of HP and handling and live way out in rural areas where they can truly put handling and HP to use. Probably not too many. I see many folks in Corvettes, BMWs driving very sedately on Interstates when I pass them in one of my vehicles (minvan). Many are driving about the same pace as golden seniors in their full-size Fords and Mercurys. They don't want to be noticed by police I guess. Maybe a large point of it all is ""to be seen in it"" and the perceived prestige.

Except for an occasional on-ramp apex or Sunday AM country back-road romp, I basically save my tires/brake pads for the racetrack, where I can really enjoy them in a controlled environment.

Oh yeah, I always park my BMW in the garage. It keeps my car cleaner longer, which means I wash/wax less frequently. It also protects the dash, seats, and paint from premature fading or cracking, and helps keep the interior temperature more comfortable year-round.

My last 300+miles to Greensboro, NC in my '03 maxima only got me roughly 27mpg @ roughly 70mph.

It was a bit nerve recking because that section of I-85 has only 2 lanes each way, So we were basically blowing past the slower (70mph) traffic in the next lane. :blush: The guy in the 325i gave up once we hit 95mph.
However, according to consumerreports.org, the 330 (225hp) mileage doesn't look all that impressive for overall driving. It's less (efficient) than the '04 TL (270hp), and equal the '03 TL-S (260hp). :confuse:
I guess to get that kind of (claimed) mileage one better start taking a vacant freeway/interstate (which, sometimes, translates to a longer route) to work.

nyccarguy - I had a 1979 Spider when I was in college - I'd love to have one today (or better yet, a 1969 boat-tail). Oh, as long as we're dreaming, I'd also like a 1972 GTV (in dark green, thank you).

blueguy - OK, I admit the top-down thing is a minus. But seriously, trunk space and fuel economy !?!?!?! (edit: Pontiac says 20 city/28 hwy). I just built an ""Emerald Green Metallic"" Solstice with LSD, ABS, and A/C for $21,500 MSRP (it looks hot!). With my GM family employee discount, that's about $18,500.

Also during the Frankfurt show, the focus was not so much on the new gas-consuming MB S series as on new fuel efficeincy endeavors by all attending auto makers! Is it mere coincidence that the two major exhibits---the MB S series and the Audi Q7 have futue hybrid versions? In fact most of the excitement was reserved for any car that boosted fuel efficiency!

Definety the sign of the times!

Maybe sometime in the future the best performance luxury sedans available will not be defined by its performance or luxury! The best future luxury performance sedan will be defined by how well it consumes gas at a given level of performance/luxury."

G35 w/ sport pkg (18'' Eagle NCT's)
Audi A4 3.2 q (17'' Eagle F1's)
BMW 330 (18'' Potenza RE050's)
The Audi had the best exhaust note, the slowest acceleration, the most body lean, and ok room inside.
The Infiniti felt quickest, had the most room inside, understeered slightly more than the BMW, and was more ""point and squirt"".
The BMW felt solid, oversteered enough to be fun, was tight inside, and had uncomfortable, hard rear seats.
There was a big bump on the course that really upset the cars, with the BMW tracking the best over it.
On the street, the 325 felt great in normal driving, but the tight interior convinced me that I made the best choice for myself and my family by buying the G35.
Oh well, there's my .02!
P.S.: On the street, the 540 was nice and roomy, but the only word that comes to mind when describing the interior is ""sterile"". I'll take an M35 or 45 any day. The Z4 just seemed like a toy; not my cup of tea."

Maybe that wasn't quite the right word to use. I also feel that the E90 does not have as attractive a view from the driver's seat as the E46, with its more cockpit-like feel. The E90's interior is less unique, more generic, less ""traditional BMW"". It seems more similar to what you might find in an Audi (not that that's bad -- just not distinctively BMW). Even the C&D review mentioned something about not caring for dash design."
4464,dewey,"September 28, 2005 3:48PM","True, the e46 cockpit- feel is missing in the e90 and that is a shame! And the reason the E90 has become more generic is because it is ""less sterile"" than older BMWs.

4473,shanky,"October 6, 2005 12:47AM","I am in Sacramento/CA, and have ordered a MB c350 (obsidian black/stone) with all options excluding all-leather and 4Matic, for invoice price+750 (costco deal). I am a first time luxury-car buyer, and had test drove BMW 325, Lexus ES330 and Avalon Ltd (all 2006) within a span of 2 days.

The MB test drive was fantastic - smooth ride, effortless and quiet acceleration, very responsive steering, rich interior (interior/exterior looks are much better than the 2006 BMW 3 series). I had test driven the BMW 325 in tight corners at about 40-50 mph (as I did with the MB), and did not notice any ""significant/superior handling"" that the beemer-fans rave about. I tested the BMW just hours before the MB, and soon as I got into the MB I could see the superior appointments - the different can be instantly felt. It was love at first sight! The BMW had very bland interior, and a straight black front panelling that I disliked (old Corolla look). Plus, I found the driver seats a bit tight for my comfort. Both BMW and MB have horrible cup-holders - the rear ones are too shallow for comfort.

On a price comparison, loading the comparable BMW 330 with the same options as the c350 gave me a price higher by about $400 for the 330. So the beemer did not have price advantage over the MB (except when you factor the free-maintainence for 4 years offered by BMW versus the $300/year needed for the MB).

The Lexus ES 330 was cool, but a bit elephantine for my needs. Same with the Avalon, which I found smoother/quiter than the Lexus. Good thing about the Avalon was the new engine (260 hp plus) and the flat flooring in the rear seat (very cool for the center seat). Also, the Lexus/Avalon looks very Camry-ish to me, and I wanted to stand out from the crowd (heh! heh!)

I did not notice significant difference between the C and S modes (Comfort/Sport) in the feel of the car, except during startup, when it starts in 2nd gear in C mode for a smooth start.

I love the 21/29 mpg rating since most of my driving is on freeways to work.

I will opt for Michelin tires though (instead of the standard all-weather Continental). I also plan on getting the wheels chromed. MB's look best when they shine!"

I did not want the AWD models (saving on mpg!) and did not test drive the BMW 330i (nor the c350 sport, nor the MB 4MATIC options). I got disinterested mostly (pardon me pls if anyone is offended !) by the interior of the 325, and hence did not try out the 330."

Is it as hot as I think it is in the summer ?

If so, I am really conflicted because I'm trying to stay as cool as possible within my two ideal color combinations for an 06 6MT....

Now that I have waited 3 years to get my TL (when they finally offer WDP w/ Ebony for 2006 - got to love it ), people are telling me that this may, in fact, be the ""warmer"" combination in the summer (So Cal) than my second favorite (Anthracite w/ Quartz). Please tell me it isn't so.....

Any opinions from any of you that have had previous cars w/ these general color combos?

Is a dark exterior/light interior a cooler temperature combo than light exterior/dark interior?

I posed this heat question to some of the engineers at work and one of them told me to take two thermometers to the Acura dealership at 2pm and quickly throw them into the two candidate's passenger seats and let them bake in the closed cars for 20 minutes. Then, open the driver's door of each car and observe the readings as they come down over the next 5-10 minutes. This may be more telling than what I could tell from a subjective ""seat-of-the-pants"" test.

Not bad advice - I actually may do it!

My concern now (after all this research) is that even after using the techniques to cool the car prior to entering, the Ebony leather will retain heat longer than the Quartz (grey), especially being trapped against my back side while the car is trying to cool on a hot summer day....

Even though the Ebony is beautiful, the day in and day out hassle of the extra heat may drive me nuts after awhile, and the beauty may turn out to really be only skin deep...:).

4505,tturedraider,"October 13, 2005 6:14AM","I have a suggestion that might give you the best of both worlds.

Tint your windows. I HIGHLY recommend Llumar brand. I have used Llumar for over 20 years and it is excellent. I have never had any problems with hazing or bubbling. Their top tier tint comes with a lifetime warranty.

Choose the top of the line Llumar product and I'm sure you will be pleased. Be sure to choose a ""metalized"" tint. They have tints now that block virtually all UV rays and have high degrees of heat rejection. You don't even have to get a really dark tint to do the job.

I always use about the second lightest tint and have very good results.

I am a big believer in white cars. I live in the Great state of Texas and you know we have tons of HOT sun! I don't have empirical evidence, but in my experience I have found that even light colored cars absorb significantly more heat than white cars do. Plus, I admit I really like the brightness and cleanness of white. Even though it seems counterintuitive, white actually hides dirt better than any other color.

High quality tinting also protects and preserves your interior.

If you have tinting on your windows and use a reflective sunshade :shades: in your windshield, I'll bet the black interior won't be too bad. btw - leather adjusts temperature much faster and better than vinyl.

my .02, fwiw

also, btw - don't get the tint done by your dealer. They'll charge you at least twice as much. Find a good Llumar dealer and let them do the installation. That's what your dealer would do and then double the price to you."

With the technology in BMW's SMG or, even trickier, Audi's DSG gearboxes. the performance of these cars with 7 or more gears and a direct mechanical connection (no torque converter) with millisecond-level shift times will make manual-clutch cars slower and clunkier to drive.

True. I, and many others, use the term ""manual"" to refer to a traditional transmission using a clutch pedal and ""H"" pattern shifter requiring input from the driver. Consider it 'shorthand'. Also, when I refer to an ""automatic"" I'm referring to cars equipped with torque converters and gearboxes that don't require input from the driver (Yes, that includes you, Steptronic!)

Just because F1 & DSG type transmissions don't have the third pedals doesn't make them automatics. I'm not sure how the DSG functions, but I know that F1 cars won't change gears without the driver ""flipping"" the little paddle. So they're definitely NOT automatics. Sometime in the future we'll have to come up with a new name for these 'hybrids', but that's a discussion for another topic.

4535,blueguydotcom,"October 20, 2005 8:42PM","Here's a good breakdown on how the DSG works:

http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/jk/031119.htm

Inside the computer controlled gearbox there are four shafts: two input shafts and two output shafts. The input shafts are concentric, with one shaft passing through the centre of the other hollow input shaft. There are two multi-plate clutch packs similar to those found in automatic transmissions. Each clutch pack connects one of the input shafts to the engine, so depending upon which is applied, either one of the two input shafts can transfer power. An oil pump at the rear of the gearbox supplies hydraulic pressure for the clutches.

The speed gears are divided between the two output shafts. First, third, fifth and reverse gear are on one output shaft while second, fourth and sixth gears are on the other shaft. Synchronisers are moved by the computer to lock each of the speed gears to their output shaft as required. Each output shaft has a pinion gear that drives the differential.

When the driver places the shift lever in drive, First gear is engaged inside the transmission, but the clutch doesn't engage until the driver steps on the gas. Because the clutch is running in oil, it can slip without burning up, allowing the car to creep along in first gear just as an automatic would. Step harder on the gas and the clutch is fully applied. A neat feature of the control system allows the driver to step on the gas and brake at the same time. Audi calls it Launch Control and it allows F1-type starts. In Sport mode with both pedals pressed, the engine revs to 3200 rpm. Release the brake and the car launches in drag strip fashion.

With the transmission engaged in first gear, the computer locks second gear to the other output shaft, but the input shaft clutch for that gear is not engaged. When it is time to shift, the computer releases the clutch for the first gear input and engages the clutch for the second gear input. In preparation for the next shift, the computer now shifts from first to third gear but leaves its clutch disengaged until the shift is requested. As the car's speed increases, the computer continues to pre-select the next gear so all it has to do is switch clutches. There is no grinding, no delays, and no shock.

By monitoring driving style, the computer predicts whether the driver will request an upshift or downshift next so it can pre-select the correct gear. It is possible to fool the computer by driving erratically, but even if the wrong gear is pre-selected it only takes a fraction of a second for it to catch up. This transmission shifts fast, with shift times in the .03 to .04 second range. Even an excellent driver has trouble matching that consistently, and this transmission can do it all day long."
4536,dave330i,"October 20, 2005 9:30PM","""It's an automatic clutch; this makes them automatics. Call it a semi-automatic or whatever you want, but it's still an automatic and nothing like a true manual transmission where the driver is an actual part of the drive train.""

If you're definition of automatic is computer controled clutch, then SMG, DSG, etc are automatics.

You're the first I know of who defines automatic that way, since majority of people & most automotive mags define automatic as having a torque converter and manual as having a clutch."

4545,designman,"October 21, 2005 2:13PM","Perhaps there is problem with the general perception of transmission genre. The term &#147;Sequential Manual&#148; is somewhat of a misnomer, only half accurate hence misleading.

Both GEAR SELECTION and TORQUE CONVERSION can be automated. The major difference between the true manual transmission and all others&#151;conventional Automatic, Sequential Gearbox and CVT&#151;is that with the true manual transmission, the human being is not only the shifter, HE IS ALSO THE TORQUE CONVERTER BY WAY OF THE CLUTCH PEDAL. He is an integral part of the transmission mechanism. It is the only type of transmission where torque conversion is not achieved automatically.

Perhaps another problem with perception is the term &#147;torque converter&#148;. Although it is a specific part in the automatic transmission, torque conversion happens in all types of transmissions, but is not commonly associated with any type of transmission except the &#147;Automatic&#148;.

Now to further convolute this mess, we must realize that the transmission itself&#151;any transmission&#151;is a torque converter. The part known as the &#147;torque converter&#148; is a transmission within a transmission. It may sound confusing but this may be because there are snags in the naming conventions to begin with.

4577,blue01s4,"October 29, 2005 4:09PM","Yes, I believe BMW is their target, but I am not convinced Lexus understands what a BMW is.

I can not agree with this statement more.

Mistakes IMO Lexus has made with regard to their pursuit of BMW with regard to ""Sportiness/Performance"":

-AWD is a great sporting application. It offers great traction in all weather conditions. However, AWD systems cause high amounts of drive line power loss . Why would you only combine an AWD system with your lower horsepower engine? This is not consistent with a goal of producing a sporty/performance vehicle. (BTW, they did the same thing with the new GS)

-Manual transmissions have always been associated with sporting/performance applications. Again, why would you only offer a MT with your lower hp engine? Again, this is not consistent with a goal of producing a sporty/performance vehicle.

-At least I have to commend them on making the vehicle RWD. Acura is still trying to make sporty FWD vehicles to compare with BMW (though they do a fairly decent job of it!).

(Now for my bias) You rarely see a Japanese made vehicle out-perform a comparable German made vehicle in any comparison (Infiniti seems to be the rare exception to the rule)."
4578,brightness04,"October 29, 2005 5:47PM","(Now for my bias) You rarely see a Japanese made vehicle out-perform a comparable German made vehicle in any comparison

You said it: it's a very biased statement. The whole statement hinges on your defnition of ""out-perform"" and ""comparable."" There are plenty Japanese cars that out accelearate and out-handle German cars in the same size segment. Ultimately, choosing a car is a balancing act among four things: size, sportiness (accelearation and handling) and luxury content, all three balanced against cost. German car makers historically have endeared itself to car rags by cheating on three out of four categories: fielding a car that was substantially smaller than compeition (3 vs. TL, G, ES, etc.), with less luxury content and interior, plus at higher cost. Three out of four compromises made, any wonder it would win in the fourth category?

Scientificly, there are two ways of defining what's comaprable: either by size or by cost. The Germans loses almost every time if either objective measures is held constant for comparison: TL and G beats 5, E and A6 on handling quite easily if size is the criterium for ""comparable."" TL and G beat 325, C230 and A4 1.8/2.0 handily if price is the criterium for ""comparable."". It is only when one relaxes standards and bias the ""comparable"" in favor of the Germans that they would win compros; any wonder in the rigged result? If you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury, chances are indeed good that you will get better handling unless the mfr is utterly incompetent."
4579,fedlawman,"October 29, 2005 7:38PM","If you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury, chances are indeed good that you will get better handling

As long as the size of the car is big enough for the target market, it doesn't matter that the E90 is smaller than the IS, they're both big enough. Personally, I think the G35 is too big - more of a mid-size car pretending (very well, mind you) to be compact.

Luxury is more than just feature content. Luxury, in large part, is qualified by the ""feel"" of an automobile. How refined is the drivetrain? How quiet is the interior? How solid is the body structure? How well does the suspension absorb impacts and/or transmit them to the cockpit? How do the doors feel/sound when you shut them? What do the plastics look/feel like? How smoothly do the controls operate?

An E90 with vinyl seats and halogen headlights may be lacking some features one expects to have in an ""entry-level luxury"" car, but it is definitely a luxurious where it really matters.

It really boils down to individual priorities. Size, amenities, handling, acceleration, refinement. All of these cars offer a different mix of them."
4580,blue01s4,"October 29, 2005 9:20PM","Here's the thing though, the Japanese mfrs are theoretically just as competent to make a great performing small or medium sized sedan as the Germans are. So why do they not make direct competition for the Germans. As you said, the 3 series is quite a bit smaller than the TL, G, ES (I can't believe you even mentioned the ES - what car has that thing ever out performed?). So, why not compete directly with them? The TSX is similar in size to the 3 series, but Acura gives it a relatively weak engine, makes it FWD and what do you expect, it doesn't compete. With regard to the TL and G which 5, E or A6 will they beat with regards to performance? That's another (IMO) problem with Japanese mfrs - they give you limited choices. You can get an A6 3.2, A6 4.2, S6 (soon) or RS6 (in a few years), and similar options exist with BMW and MB. Will the TL out perform all of them? Obviously not. You don't have to be that biased (or at all) to see that in regards to handling/performance (and I don't just mean straight line) German cars generally out perform comparable Japanese cars - IMHO of course ) Don't take this as a personal assault.

Some on Edmunds forums are saying a 6 foot man fits just fine in the back of the new IS. Perhaps its my physical limitations but I found the back of the IS250/350 uninhabitable vis-a-vis even the uncomfortable e46 I own. I am only 5-7 (145 lbs) and I could not get my legs into the foot area and place my bottom comfortably on the seat at the same time.

My pics:

Backseat of my 330i - notice i have at least 4-5 inches between my knees and the back of the driver's seat and you can even see some of the seat cushion):



My feet in the foot area of the IS250/350 - they're smashed together, my shins are painfully crushed against the back of the driver's seat and my back is flush to the backseat (Note: you can barely see a bit of the seat cushion):



My feet in the foot area of the e46 330i - notice my feet are apart and at most the lower edge of chair touches my shin. My knees are also not even bent at 90 degrees:



Is this scientific? No. Will it be true for all? No. But to my experience, with the seat in the IS250/350 in a comfortable driving position I can not even come close to sitting semi-comfortably in the back of the IS. The chinese were into foot binding for over 1000 years, maybe Japanese engineers in the 21st century have a thing for leg binding.

What you call ""options"" in the forms of S6 and RS6 are nothing more than a waste of money for the overwhelming majority of buyers of A6. The sales of S4/RS4 and S6/RS6 combined don't even make up 10% of their A4/A6 volume, and can never get their R&D money back.

4627,bscadam,"November 2, 2005 4:31AM","Not a bad dilemma to have, but it seems there are three classes of auto's there. The M3 being the true blue sports car (coupe), the C55 a step up towards family life and the bigger road wreckers blingin' in as the 550 and CTS-V. There's something awfully tempting about a Beemer being called a 550; I suppose it reminds me of something I know I&#146;ll never have from Italy. Of course, I've always wanted an M3 too..."

4629,tayl0rd,"November 2, 2005 3:21PM","It looks like you're more interested in sport and speed based on your selections. The 550i is definitely the most expensive of the bunch once you pile on the options (even before you add any options). The most sporting of the bunch will be the M3 and CTS-V. It would probably be a toss-up between the C55 and 550i (non-sport) on which is the least sporting. The 550i is decidedly larger than the others. The C55 can't be had with a manual, all the others can (the CTS-V is manual only).

If you want a fast highway cruiser for you and guests that won't beat you up on the rough roads, but won't let you down when the road gets twisty, 550i all the way.

If you want hard-core performance all the time and want to be able to get the kids ""scared straight"" in the twisties, CTS-V will do nicely.

If you want all out balls-to-the-wall performance for you and a mate, and you don't mind your body taking a little beating on the city streets, the M3 will work.

If you want to blaze down the freeway as hard as you can and don't mind slowing down a bit for the occasional bend in the road, the C55 will suit.

By process of elimination, the M3 is the only coupe in the bunch so out with that. The 550i is much bigger than the others so out it goes. By mentioning the M3, you showed that you are more on the sport side of the spectrum, and mentioning the 550i showed that you probably have passengers to haul from time to time. Both of those eliminate the C55 and that just leaves the CTS-V.

Get the CTS-V!"

4631,lovemyclk,"November 2, 2005 6:34PM",And this means what on the road race course?
4632,lovemyclk,"November 2, 2005 8:10PM","The ""readiness to swap the front and back ends"" is called oversteer, not skittishness. To me, skittishness is from uncontrolled body motions due to a less than ideal suspension setup. Controlled oversteer is, indeed, fun on the road course. Skittishness is not A 911 and it's rear engine layout has nothing in common with these cars from a handling persperctive. Most of the severe oversteer tendencies of the 911 went away several platform generations ago anyway.

Granted, a lesser skilled driver in a 997 today could drive around a road course more easily today than he/she could in a pre-993 911. Today's RWD cars - at least the ones we are discussing in this forum - are all competent... some moreso than others. The 3-Series BMW offers the finest driving experience in its class, IMO. That is not to say the IS and G are incompetent - far from it. The little things add up over the course of a road race, and I believe the 330 shines when taking this into account.

The day-to-day driving experience evens the field to a certain degree, and that is the world that contributes to the perspective taken by many drivers of these autos. Some just like knowing they have a superior driving machine, some prefer creature comforts, some are driven by their own sense of styling, etc... there is something for everyone in this class."

The only category where the IS350 was a clear winner was the drivetrain, as they liked the added power and also the transmission (they compared automatics only). One interesting comment was that they thought the IS350's interior was ""cold and Teutonic"", where the 330i's was more ""warm and inviting"". So how's that for a turnabout? Lexus over-Germanized their car? :P They also gave the BMW extra points for features like rain-sensing wipers, adaptive headlights and taillights, etc.

That's a question that will get you a lot of varied responses for sure. You don't need AWD, just like you don't really need snow tires. People like to point out the number of AWD/4WD in ditches when it starts snowing, and people also like to point out it doesn't help you stop.

That may be true, but it's stopping is not the issue when you are stuck in deep drifts and I've seen RWD, RWD with snows and FWD stuck over the last several years, as well as the same self said vehicles wrapped around telephone poles and run into ditches.

This is my pecking order of best to least-best.

As for the TL quality, you hear more on this board about it because people with problems let everybody know about it. I (and I believe the majority) do not have 'bad' problems. That being said, I do notice a slight vibration on by '04 automatic transmission at around 50-55 MPH when 5th gear kicks in. This is a legitimate problem. My dashboard has not faded. The leather has stretched a little, but it does not look bad.

Lastly, if you get the non-navi TL (comes with the horrendous Bridgestone El-42s), you WILL want to get snow tires. I did and it makes a big difference. Price that (and the costs of changing them twice a year) into your equation.

4676,laurasdada,"November 18, 2005 7:23PM","Hi, Al: Boston area resident here, TL owner. I second what most of the posts after yours have pointed out. I chose the TL over the G35x also, because in favor of the TL:

Superior interior/exterior style and interior materials.
Smoother/quieter ride.
Not having the added complexity/weight of AWD to carry around 365 days/yr.
Better mpg.
And, I suppose, a few $$$ less expensive, although that was not a major factor as I was shopping a broad price range. But a factor...

After almost 11 months, no vibrations. One rattle, but only when the sunroof is in the ""vent"" position (which the dealer said they fixed at A1 service; they did not). Leather looks fine, not brand new, but fine. Dash does seem to have a bit of the discoloration issue, but cleaning it helps.

The tires? Now that's my biggest complaint. They are terrible in the snow. And I believe they flat spot. I survived last winter, but it was a challenge. I've always driven FWD into Maine, New Hampster & Vermont to ski and in 25 years I probably would have apprecitated AWD a few times, very few times. For me, AWD is a nicety, not a necessity. TL with the Bridgestone's is the first FWD I don't feel totally snow-confident in. And it's not the car, it's the tires.

So, overall, diggin' the TL! Either is a fine choice. TL is more luxury/sport, G is sport/luxury. TL will probably be less expensive to operate overall, imho.

Good luck, keep us posted."

To me the g35x had enuff luxury but won me over with how it drove. I dont think anyone will question that the tl has the much better interior, but i felt the g was good enuff and underneath it all, was the better car.

No offense but the tl is a super accord, both good and bad. It just felt too close to the camry type cars i was trying 2 get out of. Dont get me wrong, if the tl had awd i would have snatched it up in a second, but the g just felt better on the road. I test drove each one over 4 times so i had a good feel for each car, and there are times when i sometimes think i should have gone with the tl, esp when im stuck in traffic and the nicer interior with more gadgets would have been nice. But as soon as i start moving in the g, i know i made the right choice.

BTW for me the tl was more expensive to lease, even though it stickers much less than a fully loaded g35x. MF and residuals are padded by Nissan, much more than Acura. The last thing i was gonna do was give up awd and pay more for the car."

You don't experience that in sunny CA much, but in the Northeast or the midwest awd is not a marketing gimmick. AWD is not just useful in high snow, but hilly icy driveways, left turns across busy streets, you get the idea. AWD offers a substantial traction advantage. For street driving I don't think there is a large advantage from the rwd g35 to the X. Especially for 90% of the drivers out there. If your talking Auto Cross or track performance, then there are advantages to a smaller lighter rwd package. Calling the standard g35x suspension softer than the ""sport"" G35 suspension is a reasonable comparison.

However, I was responding to Al57 who is comparing the FWD TL Vs. the g35 and asking for help with his decsion. In snowy regions, my opinion is that the AWD g35x offers handling advantages over the FWD TL. The x is primarily rwd, and does not suffer from torque steer like the TL.

The same could also be said for any decent car with a good set of winter tires. Many choose to change the odds by opting for an All-Season equiped car with AWD (some things get better, some get worse), while others are willing to spend enough to changed the odds even more by opting for AWD and winter tires.

Which is best? It depends upon where you live, how you drive and the conditions that you are willing to drive in.

Consider this; three winters ago my California born and raised wife had never driven in snow in a RWD car in her life (although she did have a little FWD experience). That winter I broke my right leg which prohibited me from driving a car with a manual transmission, and as such the situation required us to swap cars (I just positioned my casted right leg over in the passengers footwell of her car and drove left footed). Wouldn't you know it, that winter here in southern New Hampshire Mother Nature threw 114"" of snow at us forcing her to drive my winter tire shod 530i back and forth to work (round trip nearly 70 miles). Through it all she never got stuck, never was unable to make it to work or home, in fact, she never had a single problem, so much so that she threatened to break my other leg when I got out of my cast so that she could keep driving the 5er, snow or no snow.

With that in mind, I continually have to ask ""Why???"" when folks insist that they NEED an AWD equipped car ""because they live in the north east."" Sorry, not buying.

Agreed, as a life-long New Englander/skier. FWD/all-season tires and a modicum of intelligence/skill/experience when driving in snow (not that I reserve my intelligence for the snow.

AWD is a nicety, not a necessity. But it will never cease to amaze me the number of drivers that believe AWD overrules the laws of physics, e.g. Subaru Outback wagon + snow + excessive speed (after having tailgated me and illegally passed) + sharp left-handed curve, Rte. 103 into Ludlow, Vt. = Subaru firmly planted in a snow bank on the Town Green!

We just disagree on this point. With RWD with snows or without snows you slip, the DSC or whatever kicks in and engine power gets cut if needed. If you don't have DSC, tailspin.

With AWD/4WD depending on the system of course, traction gets transferred to the front wheels. It's simply more secure.

4720,shipo,"November 21, 2005 2:26PM","A couple of years ago one of the car mags did a study comparing four similar cars when driving in slippery conditions. IIRC the cars were two E320s, one RWD and one AWD, and two A6s, one FWD and one AWD, and for each car they had three sets of tires, summer, winter and all-season. Not surprisingly the winter tire equipped AWD cars fared the best in all but braking and some of the handling scenarios, however, much of their focus was comparing all-season AWD cars against their 2WD winter tire equipped siblings. Hmmm, seems fairly germane to this latest thread.

Funny thing though, contrary to some recent protestations, the only category that the all-season AWD cars won was acceleration. The winter tire equipped E320 won every other category, some of them quite handily I might add. The fact is that a winter tire equipped RWD sedan with a near 50-50 weight balance will easily out drive an otherwise identical all-season equipped AWD car. Like it or don't, I'm only the messenger in this case.

As far as some of the comments regarding how bad a winter tire shod car will drive on dry roads, well, I'm thinking that given the quality of some of the high performance winter tires that have been available for several years now, that that statement is a bit disingenuous. All of the noise to the contrary, winter tires like the ""H"" rated Michelin Pilot Alpin PA2s will easily outperform the typical OEM all-season tire on dry roads, tires such as the Continental ContiTouringContact or Michelin Energy MXV4 Plus.

Both had stock, all-season tires in the standard sizes (15"" on A4, 16"" on the 325i). I live near Detroit, where we have to deal with snow, but it's rare to have major snow of more than a few inches to get through.

In similar conditions, the A4 was definitely much better and secure feeling in getting through the snow than the BMW, but so far the BMW has been sufficient and I have not felt the need for snow tires. The A4 was more ""fun"" in the snow since I could really accelerate and let the Quattro sort out the traction; on the BMW the same action causes the DSC to kick in and I continue forward, but slowly. And I think in a really tough situation, the A4 would be more likely to get me out of it.

This spring, I intend to get a new wheel & tire package for the 325i, going to 17x8 wheels with 225/45 tires. But even though I'm probably going to stick with all-seasons for various reasons, I still plan on keeping my current 16-inchers around for winter mounting.

If I ever implied that I thought the TL would out perform the G35x in any way shape or form, regardless of road conditions, then I'm truly sorry. That was not my intent or my belief.

As for being a ""hater"" of AWD, that simply isn't the case. If I am a ""hater"" of anything it is misinformation. Specific to this discussion I'm very troubled by folks who believe without question that an AWD sedan shod with OEM all season tires will outperform a similar (or all but identical) RWD sedan shod with high quality winter tires. From the research that I've done and the driving in weather that I've experienced, the only area where the RWD car will be lacking is in acceleration in snow (or hill climbing, sort of the same thing), in every other way, the RWD/winter tire car should handily out perform the AWD/all-season car.

In my case I live on a street with two sections that feature a climb with a grade of over 7.5%, and my driveway is about 9%. Through it all my winter tire equipped 530i never had a single problem navigating either. That being said, there are six houses on my street that sport driveways that the 530i was completely unable to climb in the snow. Why? Easy, they all have at least a 20% grade between the street and the house. Were it that I lived in any of those six houses, you can absolutely bet that my wife and I would not only be driving cars with an AWD drive train, but they would both have a set of winter tires as well. Hmmm, a G35x, A4 Quattro, 330xi or 530xi with winter tires, if you want to plow through the really deep stuff or climb the really steep hills, that's your ticket. ;-)

I need to split a few hairs here. First off, let's assume like for like cars (i.e. G35 vs. G35x). Secondly, is the AWD car equipped with All-Season tires (AS/AWD) or winter tires (WT/AWD)? Third, is this hypothetical left turn made from a standing stop or are you rolling through the turn with little or no acceleration?

If we are comparing AS/AWD to WT/RWD then I believe that the following would hold true:

- From a standing stop (meaning that there is an acceleration component), the time to make the turn and clear the intersection is probably a wash with the edge going to the AS/AWD.
- Rolling through the turn, WT/RWD should easily complete the turn safer and quicker than the AS/AWD.

If we are comparing both cars shod with winter tires then I believe the following would hold true:

- From a standing stop, the WT/AWD should handily beat the WT/RWD through the intersection.
- Rolling through the turn, the WT/RWD should have a slight edge due to its lighter weight.

""The icing on the cake of owning a car like the g35x is that it is rwd based unless the car detects that you need traction. Otherwise it drives like it's rwd counterpoint, the G35.""

Errr, except for the extra weight that is. There is another factor that may or may not be present in the two versions of the G35 (but is definitely a factor with the likes of the E60 and E90 BMWs). Some manufacturers, BMW for instance, only offer a true Sport Package (stiffer/lower suspension and better rubber and wheels) on the RWD models. While this situation is not really part of the AWD vs. RWD debate per-se, it is a very real world factor to be dealt with. The standard suspension setup that comes on the AWD BMWs, while still competent, is no match for the ones that come on the RWD SP equipped models. Rain, sleet, ice, snow or dry, the better handling suspension is still the better handling suspension. To my way of thinking, an SP equipped RWD BMW will handle significantly better in the summer months versus the ""xi"" version, and during the winter months, assuming a high performance set of winter tires are used on the SP equipped ""i"", it should at least match (if not exceed) the capabilities of the ""xi"" except in hill climbing and acceleration.

So, it seems that you've called my bluff and that wasn't my last word after all. ;-)

""Having all four wheels pulling and pushing you through the curves is going to be faster, than snow tires on a rwd only car.""

Based upon various things that I've read, I'm thinking that that notion is something of an Urban Legend because it's been repeated so often. The fact is that a tire has a certain limit of adhesion, and that by adding accelerative forces to a wheel that is doing the turning, you reduce that wheels' ability to turn, or the other way around. Thinking back to the late 1980s I read a very interesting article about training road course drivers to push their cars to the very limit. Back then the racing tires were capable of about one ""G"" of tractive forces (regardless of whether it was linear or lateral), and they had developed a cute accelerometer graphing device that would log the drivers' ability to keep the needle as close to the 1G mark throughout the entire course. While theoretically possible to keep it pegged, even the best drivers were unable to keep it there all of the way around, however, there was a direct correlation between lap times and that magic 1G mark, the closer to the mark, the faster the time.

You're referring to the ""friction circle.""

Whether a wheel is being driven or not, the tire's contact patch with the road surface and the limit of adhesion determines whether the tire will grip or slip. Period.

When driving on reduced traction surfaces, the ability to maintain control of your vehicle is primarily based on the inate ability of the tire to grip the surface (contact area, tread pattern, rubber compound, etc.), control input smoothness, and speed.

Simply put, AWD helps, but it's not as important as having the proper tires and driving slowly and smoothly."

Equally as important, when a vehicle is in a turn, the four wheels trace out different circles, hence different linear velocity. The big advantage in an advanced AWD system is the ability to apportion torque to the wheel with the most grip. It's not unlike LSD on RWD cars, except this time with LSD on all four wheels. RWD with RSD beats RWD without it, all else being comparable; similarly, AWD cars win nearly all reduced friction races where they are allowed.

Regarding the driveways in question, two of them do in fact climb for some of their distance at ridiculous angles (well in excess of a 50% grade is my SOTP guess).

On the contrary, it shows a progression from more sporting/less weather capable to more weather capable/less sporting. For example, on a sport to weather capable scale of 1 to 10, 1 being a Lotus Elise and 10 being a Hummer H1, the G35 is a 3 and the 4-Runner is a 7. I'm saying the G35X is a 4.

4767,scottwin,"November 22, 2005 11:08PM","For example, on a sport to weather capable scale of 1 to 10, 1 being a Lotus Elise and 10 being a Hummer H1, the G35 is a 3 and the 4-Runner is a 7. I'm saying the G35X is a 4.

Yes, but you saying it's a 4 doesn't make it so. I can't recall the review that I read before getting the G35x but they test drove both cars and felt the G35x performed better on the sport side due to the extra weight giving the driver more confidence going into and around turns. To me this makes sense and was coming from an unbiased source. Given your rating scale the reviewer would have given the G35x something lower than a 3, maybe a 2.5 or 2.6. Personally, after driving both I couldn't tell a difference when taking an on-ramp at the highest speed I was comfortable taking.

Yes, I have driven both cars (back-to-back) and yes, I felt a definite difference in ride and handling. Your perception obviously differs.

I suspect your findings were based on your perception heading into the test drives that the AWD couldn't perform as well given the extra weight and everything else you seem to know about cars. Real world driving and how the car feels when you drive it is the only test and opinion that matters when you're spending your own money. Too bad we couldn't have like a Coke/Pepsi blindfold test and see the results. I'm sure it would be a 50/50 split between the awd vs. rwd G35 ... but then again that's just my opinion

Of course you're right. If I had to try for complete accuracy, I'd rate the G35 a 3 and the G35X a 3.2. It was easier to illustrate my point with round numbers, but of course it's my completely subjective opinion.

I also agree that a heavier car can feel more ""planted"" and confidence inspiring. I won't deny that feeling appeals to many people.

Yup, I'm sure most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

I should also admit that much of my bias stems from my opinion that the RWD G35 is itself too big and heavy. I don't know how anyone can call such a leviathan a ""sport sedan,"" and adding 200 lbs just fuels my fire."

Yup, that's exactly the article that I was referring to. When I glanced at it yesterday I noticed a November 2005 date at the top of the page and didn't bother to look any further. Of course the date was yesterday's date and the REAL publication date was May of 1999.

So, that said, it seems that my memory is a little faulty in that a RWD vs. AWD model shod like for like will show the AWD model being able to handle a little better than its RWD sibling. That one exception aside, my basic premise of a winter tire equipped RWD sedan being more capable in the snow (except for acceleration/hill climb) versus its all-season equipped AWD stable mate seems to be well proven out in this article.

Per Pat's suggestion of getting back on topic, I suggest that if we want to continue this discussion we should create a new topic, maybe ""AWD cars with All-Season tires vs. 2WD cars with winter tires"". Yes, no?

In braking, yes a clear advantage. The slalom test showed about a 1/2 mph advantage for the rwd winter tire shod Mercedes Vs. the all season shod awd copy. Not really much difference there. IF you factor in the fact that when the roads are not snow covered, your winter tire shod car will be a poor performer compared to the awd car with all season rubber, awd still offers some compelling advantages. In Minnesota anyway, there are long stretches of time that the roads are clear.

I don't drive to the apex of turns anymore, but I don't want to feel the thing rolling all over the place either. I want it to be comfortable. I am in it 3 hours a day - and it needs to be reliable. I have a really long commute, and I have no desire sit on the side of the rode. I will be shooting to put 200K on the car, or more. Finally it has to have an A/T so my wife can drive it too.

With winter tires you should do fine in mountains.
But one thing that nobody ever mentions is ground clearence. The sedans all probably have only five or so inches of clearence at suspension mounting points, and my car seems to have even less at the front chin.

4779,buff86soho,"November 26, 2005 3:28AM","bplayer's list is helpful -- similar to mwhitt, I'm looking at AWD sedans, would like to stay around $32-36k if possible, and am currently looking at:

Audi A4 Quattro 2.0T
Infiniti G35x
Lexus IS250 AWD
BMW 325xi
Acura TL (not AWD, but on my list anyway)

I'm currently in a 2003 Passat Turbo 4-cyl. I like the driving qualities, want a more upscale interior as well as some extra power and the AWD. Not sold on the look of the new Passat, looking to go to a more premium brand.

Just started looking, drove the G35x today which had nice amenities but the 280hp is probably more power than I need at the expense of some things that for me should be a no-brainer at this price range (i.e., trip computer). It also drives a little loud (the sales guy described it as the trademark Infiniti ""engine growl""). My commute is beat-up city streets, so I'm looking for a soft ride (as opposed to an overly-tight sport suspension).

Haven't yet determined which of the ones on my ""list"" is the benchmark against which all others will be measured -- suffice it to say that, for me, the '03 Passat is a pretty good benchmark at this point. Seems like many consider the BMW 3-series to be the benchmark, particularly for those like me who like the ""German-engineered"" driving experience (whatever that means). I'm particularly interested in anybody's initial reactions to the new Lexus IS250 AWD -- there doesn't seem to be much out there on it yet. Given that I haven't driven the Audi, Lexus, BMW, or Acura yet, I'm open to any input.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and feedback."
4780,bplayer,"November 26, 2005 6:09AM","You may not get a soft ride for any of the cars on your list, except for the A4. Most of them are classified as luxury/sport, so the suspension may be too stiff for you. Make sure that you drive some of these bad road when you test drive.

Another criteria to consider is space, especially in the back set. If you are not tall or typically very infrequently have average size people in the back then all these cars will be fine. If space is an issue, I think the IS250 will be the first drop out."
4781,mnrep2,"November 26, 2005 1:27PM","I ended up with an 05 g35x in July. There are a multiple of reasons to choose one car over the other, but my process of elimination was:

RWD bias of the awd package.
G35x has a larger interior volume than the BMW 3 series.
Have owned German autos prior, My 2000 Passat glx was a wonderful car, but needed a timing belt (around $1K), AM radio had stopped working (Again, $400 repair to keep stock antenna with existing radio)and finally, the interior at 75K miles was squeaking a lot. Finally, my assumption that a Japanese automobile will be more reliable than its German competitors.

So far I'm happy with the choice. Don't know about the 200K miles, but I think the Infiniti has a better shot than most. You have to drive the cars that fit your parameters, and pick which one fits your budget, and tickles your fancy the best. There are a lot of cars for you to choose from have fun shopping!"
4782,buff86soho,"November 27, 2005 4:03AM","Thanks for the input, mnrep2 and bplayer. Great advice about test-driving on bad roads, bplayer. (duh, should've thought of that before I drove the G35x). It's been snowing here in Cleveland over Thanksgiving, but not enough to really get a feel for the advantages of AWD.

Drove the IS250 and the Acura today. Yes, the IS250 is definitely tight on interior space as you noted, bplayer. Not just the back seat (ridiculously little legroom), but headroom throughout -- and I'm only 5'9"" on a good day. Having said that, the IS has all the features I want without paying extra for a bunch of features I don't want. The heated AND ventilated seats are great, the push-button start is awesome (as with the G35x). The IS250 redesign is fantastic! I found the pickup on the highway to be underwhelming -- and I wasn't looking for outrageous. It felt like my Passat turbo would probably hold its own with the Lexus on a pull-out-and-pass test head-to-head. The Lexus dealership setup was truly impressive -- the free carwashes, TV room, coffee bar, eat-off-the-floor service dept., massive fleet of service-loaner vehicles, pickup/dropoff service, etc. -- my daughter compared it to a Westin hotel.

The Acura had a great set of standard features. I was amazed at the pricepoint with all those features included -- acknowledging, of course, that if it were an AWD it would likely be +/-$2k more. Much roomier than the Lexus, closer to the G35x in interior space but not as luxuriously-appointed. The dashboard gauges looked dated ('80s or '90s styling). Despite the 3.2L V6 which is more than adequate for my purposes, it didn't have the power of the Infiniti. My first car was a Honda and I love the Honda/Acura quality and reliability.

Both the Lexus and Acura handled rough roads firmly but not too stiff.

mnrep2, your experience is reminding me that I'm glad to be getting out of my Passat before the warranty expires. I've already had to have my antenna replaced under warranty as well as the seat-heater (shorted out and burned my jeans!). I wonder if Audis have similar reliability issues?

Next up -- the bimmer and the A4. Without driving it, on paper the 325xi looks like it'll require a number of options to compare to the others that will put it several thousand dollars higher. I've got high hopes for the A4 -- expecting it to come in at a price-point and features that fit my budget and preferences (b/c I'll probably be willing to take the 2.0L instead of the 3.2L, a compromise that for me saves $$)."

I had an open mind and was open to all options including the G35 Coupe, IS350 the 330i and the A4. I drove all four. Before I took any test drives I was sure I wanted the Lexus. However, once I sat in it and started to drive I knew it was not for me. It felt soft, much like a large family car and the cockpit was very cramped as well as the steering wheel being too small. It has pretty good acceleration but did nothing to inspire me and clearly is not a drivers car.

The 330i was very much a drivers car but I just didn't like the interior that much and truthfully didn't really like the snobby attitude at the dealership so that turned me off to them.

The G35 had tons of torque but the little things really bugged me. For example the power seat controls being located up top and the interior didn't seem to have as high quality materials as the others I had driven. In addition the fuel economy leaves alot to be desired.

My last stop was The Collection. They sell Ferrari, Porsche, Maserati and Audi. No sooner did I walk in when I was being offered coffee and pastrys. The dealership was gorgeous and the sales guy was a no b.s type of guy who I liked. I didn't really like the A4's I saw until I saw one with the S-Line package. Wow! what a looker. The interior was the finest I have ever sat in and it was tight and drove beautifully ( 2.0t , 6 spd). I was sold. I knew Audis depreciate horribly so leasing was the only option for me. They had a great 24 month lease program with 75% residual value and .00139 money factor. That simply cannot be beat. I am driving a 40k car with nothing down and $480 a month as well as free maintenance to boot. Trust me, I was never a fan of Audi but after driving all 4 there was no comparison.

I have narrowed to the two extremes G35X and the Outback XT Limited for a variety of reasons. I need AWD so these are where I have landed.

Frankly, I like the Audi best of all, but nobody seems to be able to convince me of the reliability and service experience that I desire. It is a great drive, but these boards continue to say never own outside of warranty. Well, I can't accept that. I put far too many miles on a car to be trading every 1.5 years.

On the Passat - my wife has an '02 4-motion that has been a dream, but her friends had nightmares on the same car and traded within 6 months. Not into roulette.

On the XT, the owners say it is a great value, handles well and great $$$ value. With their incentives you can out around 30K-32K depending on option load. I did a check of used cars on carsdirect.com and there are a lot with 150K+ miles. Add in that CR rated the Subaru Outback as one of the most reliable used cars to purchase.

I think I can get a G35x for $36K without TTL. I drove that car for an hour the other day. Comfortable, handled well, powerful. And my sister-in-law says it handled beautifully in the snow and ice.

4810,mwhitt,"December 4, 2005 2:28AM","i don't see any real difference on the MPG. maybe you see something different than what Edmunds is showing. so it comes down to premium vs regular, which is what $0.25 a gallon, if that. what are you saving, couple of hundred a year if you are 15K a year driver.

if you're indifferent between the cars, go for the lower gas costs i guess. i wouldn't think that if you can lay out over $30k out the door for a car, that this savings would mean a whole heck of lot. i would say throw out the gas issue, and pick the car you like the most. seems like a non-starter to me."

IMO, I really enjoyed test driving the ES and thought it was luxurious, solid, and a comfortable drive. That being said, yes you need only put in regular gasoline in the Lexus but to say that the Acura has only ""slightly greater responsiveness"" is a misstatement in my opinion. The TL although FWD, is in a different category than the ES as far as performance is concerned. BTW, are you prepared to spend 30,000-35,000 this year on a vehicle that is getting remodeled for 06?"

I'm thinking about either the IS250 AWD or a BMW 330xi. This is my first new car purchase in a long time. Went to the Lexus dealership for a test drive. I live in Chicago and there was a dusting of snow on the ground - nothing remotely serious.

First strange thing: the guy coming in from his test drive remarks that the ""driver assist"" feature came on during his test drive. I didn't pay much attention. However, I was taking a pretty easy turn which would not have been a problem for my old Camry and the IS slipped on the turn causing the driver assist feature to kick in.

This disturbed me. I don't think (though I have little experience) the 330xi would have done that. Could this just be a tire issue or is this driver assist system screwed up?

Has anyone else experienced this with the IS, or has anyone driven the IS in snow? I like the features for price of the IS though it feels a little cramped, but I really liked the way the BMW drove. Felt very firm and controlled. However, it wasn't snowing when I test drove the BMW.

I have never owned either a lexus or a bmw. Thanks for any help or experience!

4823,gordonwd,"December 6, 2005 1:47PM","I have a 325i, not xi, in the Detroit area and so far have gotten along OK with the standard all-season tires through one winter (although this year is looking like it could be a lot worse!). Anyway, my impression is that the more recent ""stability"" controllers are getting more sensitive and tend to kick in with very little slippage. In some cases I guess this is good, but I find that I often prefer turning off the DSC and letting the car spin its wheels and fishtail a little bit.

With the DSC on, I had a couple instances of pulling out from a slippery side street onto a main road, when the DSC kicked in and caused the car to feel like the engine just bogged down big-time, and there I was trying to get into a moving flow of traffic with no power! I'd prefer a little wheelspin and I'm fully capable of keeping it moving in the right direction.

So don't let the stability control's kicking in unfairly color your opinion of either car (even though the BMW is the obvious choice )."

What are your thoughts?"
4831,cdnpinhead,"December 13, 2005 2:25AM","I posted the following (in error) several days ago in the Luxury Performance Sedans board. Apparently there are fewer manual transmission fans there than I thought. Anyway, FWIW:

A couple of years ago I learned that my present car (Lincoln LS) was going to be cut adrift -- it's not discussed here, but six years ago, we thought it was going to be quite something. Oh well. . . It'll good for the forseeable future, but in the next 6-30 months, I'll probably pull the lanyard on something different.

I have three requirements for my lux or ""near-lux"" car: 1) manual transmission, 2) rear-wheel drive, 3) must carry my bicycle inside (really big back seat, fold-down seatbacks or Avant style).

Then I have a few ""nice-to-haves"": good long-term reliability (100-200K miles), decent fuel mileage & dealers that have a clue regarding sports sedans & proper service.

The only three (lux or near-lux) vehicles on the planet that meet my requirements are the BMW 3, the BMW 5 and the G35 coupe. Given that, I compromised and added the IS250 (no fold-down seat), the A4 Avant (AWD) & the A3 (front-wheel drive) to my matrix. And, IMHO, the long-term reliability of both the BMW & Audi are suspect.

I tend to avoid bells & whistles, but still like some amenities: sport suspension/wheels/tires, upgraded audio & xenons; Homelink is simple & useful. I appreciate being able to select just what I want (German), though the Infiniti premium package covers most of what I want without too much fluff. I looked at the 330, since the upgraded audio & xenons were standard, but the extra dollars beyond that were wasted on me. I guess I don't crave the extra horsepower & much of the rest I care about even less.

Two that meet all my requirements (BMW 3 & G35 coupe) came within $40 of each other (sticker or invoice), set up the way I want. My present car has taught me that extra size and weight (as in the BMW 5) are of little value.

Hmmm . . . I yap a lot about Asian reliability, but the reality is that I could have a 325 for the same price as a G35 (in country). Since I'm more than willing to do the ED thing, the 325 starts to look even better. Plus which, Electric Red is just about the most attractive (to me) colour in the class. And, finally, Shipo has helped me come to grips with the concept that owning a BMW doesn't necessarily cause one to become a poseur and/or lower life form.

More later, as I review the last 3-5 pages of each of the brochures. Those tables are where the action is, for me -- the standard equipment & option packages take awhile to dissect & compare.

Edit -- I may add the CTS to the mix. More research is required, though I'm very reluctant to try yet another American franchise used to dealing only with people who have been in the AARP at least 15 years."
4832,calidave,"December 13, 2005 6:57AM","I'm really struggling. I'm going from a convertible that is fairly spartan. It has neither luxury nor sportiness, but I like it for what it was. Still, I don't want ANOTHER one!!

We already have an SUV, which gets used for toting the teenagers and their friends to soccer, etc. and for getting us up to the mountains on occasion. So I need a daily commuter that I won't be embarassed to be seen getting out of in the corporate parking lot.

Plus.....I simply can not drive a gas guzzler. Because of the job I have, it would be inappropriate for me to drive something that gets 15 mpg and LOOKS like it is getting 15 mpg. My current car passes the smell test (and does get 21 mpg). But a Mustang wouldn't. And I do get some grins, personally, by driving a fuel-efficient vehicle. But that's just me.

My only experience buying used was not a great one. Yes, I ended up with a nicer car than I would have bought new. But I did end up with maintenance issues that I would have been less likely to have if I bought new.

What I've learned, given my need to store my bicycle inside the car, is that fold-down rear seats doesn't necessarily yield an acceptable result. In an effort to improve torsional rigidity, some of the cars that advertise (& deliver) fold-down rear seats don't mention that the resulting hole isn't rectangular and as wide as the interior. It's a rounded triangle that may (or may not) accept a bicycle, sans its front wheel.

Renting the car to do a test isn't necessary. Clean up your bike and take it to the dealer. Try it. That's my plan.

The G35 coupe, which is either #1 or #2 on my hit parade on any given day (relative to the 325), has one of these triangular pass-throughs. In due course, I'll determine whether it's adequate. And, of course, I need to check out the BMW in the same fashion, as well as the CTS.

The pickings are getting slimmer.

I threw the Audi offerings in because I thought they might finally be offered in the U.S. with the diesel. No joy. I even looked at an X3 because it has the manual option and lots of room for the bike.

In any event, I've got a matrix involving nine vehicles, of which only a few are real contenders -- BMW 3's (325 & 330) & the G35 coupe.

If I wished to be whipped about the head and shoulders and disappointed yet again by an American brand that thinks it wants to compete, I'd add the two CTSs to the mix. Not bl**dy likely, but still remotely possible.

""MBs reputation during the last few years does scare me a bit. The care has been around since the fall of '00). Drive the BMW and the MB back to back and see what you think is sportier. The 3 series will come out on top.""

Respectfully, I don't agree - because one of the major premises seems incorrect (about being around since fall 2000).

First of all, the engine and transmission for the C350 new to the C-class for 2006; and the transmission is new in total for 2005. I don't know how long the engine has been around - but not THAT long. Its a new car, moves faster, shifts better.

Second, the new MB C350 has greater horsepower and torque than the new BMW 330i - although they are close - not sure how this translated in the driving experience - but would have to test. I can't imagine BMW would have much of an edge - the cars are nearly as evenly matched as you can get.

Third, for me, maneuverability is a plus. The MB C-series has a tighter turning radius than the BMW 3-series. Its also 4.5"" narrower - which is huge in the urban area where I live. Makes it easier to squeeze through and feel in control.

The best way to find out is to try each, and see what meets your needs. I was surprised by the new MB C-series on paper - but I can't talk too strongly in that I've only seen them not driven them."

5.7L/100 km means about 41.3 US mpg. Euromix means basically a mix of City, roads and mortoway, so this mileage is actually reachable for a careful driver.

Since asking the question, I've taken the effort to answer it on my own. The 9-car matrix mentioned earlier (by me) has now become 11.

Would I wish to be caught dead in a Mercedes? No. OTOH, I felt much the same about BMWs until recently, but for much different reasons. I will attempt to be objective, but that Electric Red BMW 3 is calling me. I'll buy enough insurance to get me to 100K, and if it's been a trooper to that point, then I'll go bare.

My favourite road in the world upon which to evaluate cars is between Nevada & California in an area where almost no one goes. There is a corner (RH) where the road drops away & if the car isn't up to it, people die. I've done it in a 240Z, a 510, two different Miatas, an Eagle Vision, my Lincoln LS and . . . (wait for it) a Chevrolet BelAir. Some of my cars have done much better than others.

First of all, I was replying to a previous post - not necessarily touting the MB C350. A lot of people throw out lists here - and exclude MB from the comparison set. The Canadian starting this recent thread included the BMW 3-series and the G35; but not the MB. I'm still puzzled about that. My purpose in the post is to point out that MB is a good option. Can't understand why so many people don't even consider it. I never said the MB was head and shoulders over the BMW; its just so many others say the BMW is great - and never consider the MB. I don't get it - they look darn close to me; with on paper a slight edge to MB for my needs.

In my car searches, I drove Volvo for the last 15 years. I've always been happy with them until my most recent purchase. Visibility is poor; turning radius is much bigger than previous version. So now I'm looking for a replacement. I didn't really consider MB at first either, until I saw the C350/C280. On paper, the new C-series fits what I'm looking for. (Small car, high performance, good visibility)

I agree the reliability issues are of some concern; although I'm not concerned with a newish engine and transmission. MB hasn't had problems there. Its been primarily electronics and some suspension from what I've seen."

I can agree with this statement somewhat. One example, buying a brand-name suit at a discount warehouse vs. buying the same suit at an upscale store. One saves thousands buying the same suit at the former.

Of course there is not real loser. Only real customers. You can elect to pay the going rate (or market price) for the e90 (or Rolex, MB, Armani suit, TL, or steak at the Palm etc...) or not. You don't like the going rate you are always free to vote with your dollars somewhere else."

I had the bad timing to lease a 2002 530i in the spring of 2002 while still living in New Jersey. They charge sales tax on the depreciated portion of the car (i.e. the difference between the negotiated price of the car and the calculated residual). Fortunately for me I got the car via the ED program and as such I only had to pay sales tax on about $14,000. The unfortunate part was that I moved up here to New Hampshire not three months later, where there is no sales tax on cars (or any other sales tax for that matter), however, there is a vehicle tax applied by our town each year when you register it, so I got dinged for nearly $1,000 twice in 2002. :-(

Of course it's still pretty easy to justify living up here, consider the following:

- Even with NJ's high property taxes, our property taxes went down about $3,000 per year by moving up here. Advantage NH.
- Our car insurance dropped about $500 per year. Advantage NH.
- Car tax difference are a wash for the first year of ownership and then anywhere from $500 to $1,200 annually for any make/model/year of vehicle that I'm likely to want to drive. Advantage NJ.

Balancing out the above three items I figure that we are about $1,500 ahead by living in New Hampshire, even with the annual vehicle tax.

I did some research and found this post (5019) cdnpinhead, ""Entry-Level Luxury Performance Sedans"" #5019, 12 Dec 2005 6:25 pm

have three requirements for my lux or ""near-lux"" car: 1) manual transmission, 2) rear-wheel drive, 3) must carry my bicycle inside (really big back seat, fold-down seatbacks or Avant style)....The only three (lux or near-lux) vehicles on the planet that meet my requirements are the BMW 3, the BMW 5 and the G35 coupe.

WTF? Maybe a 5 or 3 wagon could hold a bike. A G35 coupe? Did you try that? I can't see how that's possible given the fact the G35's trunk is tiny and it's backseat is a torture chamber.

Given that, I compromised and added the IS250 (no fold-down seat), the A4 Avant (AWD) & the A3 (front-wheel drive) to my matrix.

The A4 avant, A3 and Matrix seem realistic. Might as well go Mazda3 - better handling than the other 3 and much better manual shifter too. The IS250 simply makes no sense given your bike requirement...the backseat in the IS250/350 is a joke.

CTS...again, this seems weird with your bike requirement. FWIW, I think the CTS and IS250/350 handle like pigs.

In the winter, that built-in ski bag is really a nice feature and will hold two pairs of cross-country skis without having to fold the seats down.

One other feature notable for bicyclists (and others): the E46, at least, has built-in roof-rack mounting points.

I was looking hard at '04 & '05 BMW 330i's. Loved the drive but thought the interior lacked some of the pleasantries that most all cars have these days, even my '95 Buick!

I LOVE the exterior of the G35 coupe and thought it was really fun to drive, but it seemed so noisy when I sat in the back seat.

I guess it depends on your definition of luxury: are you looking for a ""luxury"" nameplate, or just ""luxurious"" amenities, like leather and power everything?

In addition to the Mercedes C-class and BMW 3-series, the Volvo S40 and Audi A3 would meet your size requirement. I personally would be concerned with the reliability of those options and would lean more toward your choices from Lexus and Acura. If you're willing to do a coupe, you may want to look at the RSX, too.

If you just want leather and other goodies, you may want to consider a Mazda 3, a Subaru Impreza or a Saab 9-2X (which is basically a gussied-up Impreza). Each of these can be had with leather, sunroof, upgraded audio, etc., while still meeting your length requirement.

If a shorter length is truly a requirement you may also want to consider a small SUV (I know, it's probably blasphemy here and probably belongs on a different forum, but)--several choices would meet your requirement and add cargo capacity, too.

My two cents: the IS250 is absolutely, hands down the most attractive car on the list!

It IS a challenge finding something under 183""! I guess I can go larger; I just don't want to - my car now is 193"" & I just like the smaller ones. I don't care about a luxury nameplate - I just like the amenities, like leather & xenon lights & maybe the built-in garage door opener, and I want illuminated radio controls on my steering wheel (my old Buick has those but my hubby's new Maxima's are not illuminated). I just can't do an SUV!!

I haven't driven the Volvo S40 yet but I will - it looks kinda cute! My ex-brother-in-law just retired from being pretty high up at Ford & he told me to stay away from the Volvo! He recommends the IS.

I didn't like the dash on the Saab 9-3, but I'll surf now & look at the 9-2x you mentioned, as well as the Mazda & Subaru.

I looked at the RSX but felt it was a little too bare-bones for me. The TSX is probably just right for me, but the looks of the IS just make me drool!

My dad had a Hona Prelude a hundred years ago - i wish they still made that! Actually I'd REALLY like to find a ""fake"" '55 - '57 TBird that is a ""modern"" car under the shell!

High-speed stability was excellent.

As someone else mentioned, one man's taunt car is another's sloppy jallopy. The 06 GLI, for people who drive as if medicated, will feel tight and fun.

I tend to push my cars far more: the end result then, most cars to me feel undrivable. On my drive of the GTI the salesman was shocked that I didn't like the car. He commented that nobody on his test drives has pushed the car as hard as I or as smoothly (he actually wanted to know if I race in auto-X or semi-professionally). He expected I would have liked it given the way I drove it. Nope. It can't hold a candle to what I drive now or several other cars.

A CD changer can be had for the 3er fairly inexpensively. That being said, why mess with a changer at all? For my money I'll get an iPod and plug it into the Aux port.

Regarding the comment about the security system. You do know that all recent BMWs (since 1999 at the very least) have been equipped with a very sophisticated and comprehensive anti-theft/security system, don't you? True, the E90 lacks an audible alarm, but who really cares about that, it&#146;s simply a device that simply pisses everybody off anywhere within earshot and doesn't deter a thief one bit. That being said, for the very reasonable price of $232.05 (from pacificbmw.com) a fully integrated and easily installable alarm can be purchased.

To build on what shipo said about the 3-series...

Their anti-theft includes an ignition imobilizer. Basically, you can't start the car unless you have the little computer chip that's stored in the key.

If someone's breaking into your car to steal something inside of it, then an audible alarm won't scare them off at all... They'll just grab what they want (CDs, money, bags, etc) and run. (BTW, most people just ignore alarms going off in parking lots... Don't you? :P )

4948,shipo,"January 17, 2006 3:52PM","""If they really want to steal the car, then BMW's system is extremely effective in preventing that.""

Absolutely correct. To help further illustrate this point, back in 1999 when I moved from a 1995 Passat GLX to a much more expensive 1999 328i my car insurance went down! ""Not that I'm complaining mind you,"" I told my insurance agent, ""but why?""

""Because our experience with BMWs is that they are very hard to steal and as such, we have very few payouts for that type of loss.""

Thinking about this another way, I've been active on the 3-Series and 5-Series discussions since mid-1998 and in that entire time I can only remember one car that was reported to have been stolen. Apparently it was picked up and put on a flat-bed or into a trailer, and this was a car with the alarm system installed. In the end, if a professional thief wants your car, he/she will get it and no alarm/Lojack/OnStar system will prevent its loss. Period, full stop, the end.

4964,mvc_jones,"January 20, 2006 11:13PM","If you want something simple, nice, good in the snow with limited luxury (and back seat room) a Subaru Legacy or Legacy GT might be a good choice, and they tend to last a long time.

They are not considered a luxury brand (but aspire to be one) but a very solid car, and the GT is quite powerful/fun to drive. Main issues for me were subpar gas mileage, smaller backseat, and design was a little on the plain side (although tasteful and simple.)

This was my second choice to the Acura TL, TL was a better value proposition to me (even though it cost more), I liked the design, features, back seat room, etc... Snow was not an issue in my purchase though.

Luxury is a bit of a tough word to me now because non-luxury cars are more and more incorporating features that are generally considered luxury. Look at a full loaded Accord V6 with Nav vs. Acura TL or Lexus ES and you will see what I mean. To me, main differences are design quality (based on taste), material quality, and 'tuning' of engine, suspension, steering, etc..."

The difference has to do with such arcane things as inter-axle & limited-slip differentials.

I'm guessing you couldn't care less. AWD is automatic and is generally the best choice for those who are mostly concerned with highway traction (as opposed to off-road stuff). Subaru is the reigning king of this, but if you want ""luxury"" (however you define it -- there's lots of bickering potential here), the BMW & Audi options are good ones, and some are willing to admit that the Infiniti G can play too. I've spent quite a bit (but not nearly enough) of my life in Colorado, and I can assure you that the most common vehicle driven by locals in the ""high country"" (above 8000 feet -- say Winter Park/Fraser/Granby) is the Subaru.

Audi has been doing this longer than anyone, and has the best (bar none) interiors in the business. Even if you don't know what luxury means, after you've sat in an Audi, you'll at least have a starting point."

4970,bdr127,"January 21, 2006 2:57PM","Should I be sticking with the AWD vehicles? Is there a downside to awd?

For most people it's not really an issue... but 1) with AWD, you get a slight loss in power and performance, because engine power is split between all wheels, as opposed to just two wheels. 2) Some people don't like the ""awkward"" feeling of the back-and-forth between oversteer and understeer. 3) AWD almost always results in lower gas mileage than the same car with 2WD. 4) AWD will almost always be more expensive than the same car with 2WD.

I could be forgetting some things.... Regardless, I'm not trying to make a case against AWD, because I had an Audi A4 Quattro and loved the AWD system. You just wanted to also know the disadvantages."

That can be a plus for a big luxury car, but in a sport sedan we expect a seat-of-the pants feeling, and we didn't get it from the IS 350. We're tempted to blame that on such features as the Lexus's electronic throttle, which uses sensors on the gas pedal and computerized engine controls to replace the cable that usually connects the driver's foot to the engine. Or maybe it's the fact that the IS 350 isn't available with a manual transmission. (We had a lot of fun driving a BMW 3 Series with its manual option.) But those answers seem too simple. After all, we've enjoyed driving cars with automatics -- or even models with too much electronic wizardry -- when a winning vehicle lies beneath the gadgets. Somehow, the IS just doesn't hang together to create what we'd call a driver's car."

For the German speaking. Very interesting comparison test between Lexus IS 250 and BMW 325.

To sum things up :
1) The 3 is a bit quicker (0-100km/h in 7,3' instead of 8,1'). the IS engine is a bit strained
2) it offers more mpg by 10-15%

The reason I am asking you is, I am waiting for Toyota to introduce the GS350 because it seems like something I would be intrested in. The current AWD drive version of the GS is very sluggish in my estimation as well as the 530XI from BMW.

4993,pgsmith,"January 24, 2006 2:31AM","I would agree w/ bdr127.

I have a C280 w/ AWD. I am guessing I lose ~2-3mpg vs rwd. I took a recent road trip and only averaged 27.5 mpg cruising ~75.

Many will argue that rdw or fwd is all you need (and not without merit). My preference was to sacrifice the 2-3mpg and power (yes, it is a noticable difference if you drive with any spirit).

W/ rwd or fwd, you will do much better w/ snow tires. You will likely be better off with tires designed for ice and snow than M+S or A/S for winter driving (assuming you keep it on the road), although they often have a softer tread compound making them wear quicker.

I have not really noticed a back and forth oversteer/understeer , or maybe I'm just used to it as I have been driving 4wd and AWD for years and may unconsciously compensate for it (or use it to my advantage).

Cost is a disadvantage although the level of the impact can be argued if you choose to run two sets of tires and consider the resale value the AWD will have. I beleive here has been a whole discussion on that subject. Cost is also subjective if you are considering multiple vehicles like Subaru vs 3-Series or C-series or whatever. (I'm sure that last statement will ruffle feathers, but everyone has a different vehicles they will consider.)

Ultimately, drive 'em and see what you like."

Do you know many BMW-based brands that can be bought and serviced in the BMW network (in Europe)?
Dinan just makes some aftermaket tuning pieces whereas Alpina has its cars built on BMW lines and fit with their powertrains in their own factory. Engine is individually signed by the Engineer in charge. Alpina don't sell upgrade chip and can not sell performance upgrade for second hand BMW.

The B5 they are making is considered as the most serious rival to the M5, with the benefit of extra exclusivity

Anyway, it is your choice, but Alpina can't be compared to Hartge or Schnitzer or even Brabus."
